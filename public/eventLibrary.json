The Haitian Revolution was the only slave uprising that led to the founding of a state which was both free from slavery, and ruled by non-whites and former captives.\n\nThe revolt began on August 21st, 1791, in what was then the French colony of Saint-Domingue. After a well-attended vodou ceremony, thousands of slaves began to kill their masters and plunged the colony into civil war. Within the next ten days, slaves had taken control of the entire Northern Province in an uprising of unprecedented scale.\n\nThe fighting was particularly brutal, and more than 200,000 black people died in the years from the initial uprising until independence.\n\nAlthough Toussaint Louverture established himself as a military leader of the revolution by 1801, he died shortly before independence was won. Jean-Jacques Dessalines, his former lieutenant, became the first leader of Haiti.",

The fighting lasted eleven days and estimates of those killed range from 300-400. The EZLN remains active to this day.",

He was a charter member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in Amite County and sought to enfranchise black Americans by encouraging voter registration.\n\nIn 1961, Lee assisted Bob Moses, a field secretary with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), in his efforts to persuade locals to register. His activities were met with threats of reprisal by the white community, and Lee became one of the movement's earliest victims to white violence. On September 25th, 1961, Lee was murdered by Mississippi state representative E. H. Hurst (1908 - 1990) in broad daylight at the cotton gin while delivering cotton near Liberty.\n\nHurst killed Lee with a single shot to the head, but later claimed in court that he was defending himself after Lee attacked him with a tire iron. An all-white jury ruled that the killing was a justifiable homicide. In 1964, civil rights activist Louis Allen was killed after he informed federal investigators that his testimony in the case was forced on threat of violence.",

He regarded these as a new form of organization capable of overcoming the limitations of the old institutions of the labor movement, the trade unions and social democratic parties.\n\nHe was a sharp critic of anarchism, social democracy, and Leninism. During the early years of the Russian revolution, Pannekoek gave critical support to the Bolsheviks. In later analysis, however, Pannekoek argued that the Bolsheviks crippled the workers' soviets, and formed a new ruling class of their own party. Unlike some other progressives of his time, Pannekoek was also highly critical of social darwinism, derisively calling it \"bourgeois darwinism\".",

The raids targeted suspected leftists and labor activists, mostly Italian and Eastern European immigrants, especially if they were anarchists or communists, and generally sought to deport them from the United States.\n\nThe raids and arrests occurred under the leadership of Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer, with more than 3,000 arrested. Though 556 people were deported, including many prominent leftist leaders like Emma Goldman, Palmer's efforts were largely frustrated by officials at the U.S. Department of Labor, which had authority for deportations and objected to methods.\n\nOn this day in 1920, the Justice Department launched its second series of raids against leftists and labor organizers across more than 23 states, arresting more than 3,000 people. Because the raids targeted entire organizations, agents engaged in mass arrests, and President Hoover later admitted that there were \"clear cases of brutality\".\n\nAlthough the DoJ initially claimed to have taken possession of several bombs, no evidence of the bombs was produced. In their entirety, all the raids only confiscated four pistols.",

        "description": "Dundalli, executed by the state on this day in 1855, was an Aboriginal lawman who mediated conflict between European settlers and indigenous aboriginal peoples in the area of Brisbane in South East Queensland.\n\nHistorically described as a murderer, savage, and terrorist, he is now thought to have been as an indigenous leader who coordinated decade-long resistance to colonization.\n\nIn the escalating tensions between indigenous people and settlers around Brisbane, Dundalli's role as a tribal leader led to widespread speculation as to his instigation of various violent conflicts. Despite this perception, modern historians note that he had not exacted revenge for his brother's murder at the hands of a settler and rival tribe, and had saved at least one settler's life in a raid, suggesting Dundalli had adopted a more conciliatory policy of moderation rather than \"savage\" violence.\n\nIn 1854, Dundalli entered Brisbane to be paid for removing a felled tree and was arrested by the police. Tried and convicted for murder on flimsy evidence, he was hanged a few months later on this day in 1855.",

These revolutionaries included Juan R\u00edus Rivera, Segundo Ruiz Belvis, Ram\u00f3n Emeterio Betances, and Jos\u00e9 Francisco Basora.\n\nThe Committee began planning an armed revolution in Puerto Rico in early 1868, issuing several \"Proclamas\" criticizing Spanish exploitative practices and demanding rebellion against the government. On September 23rd, 1868, the Revolutionary Committee, led by Betances, declared independence in the city of Lares, Puerto Rico, calling it the Republic of Puerto Rico.\n\nSeveral hundred rebels took over city hall, looted stores owned by \"peninsulares\" (Spanish-born men), and took some of the store owners prisoner. The revolution was put down however by the Spanish militia and around 475 rebels imprisoned. The event became known as \"El Grito de Lares\" (shown above).",

The group emerged in 1960 from the student-led sit-ins at segregated lunch counters in Greensboro, North Carolina and Nashville, Tennessee and played a key role in helping black people in the South both register and exercise their right to vote.\n\nOn this day in 1966, the SNCC adopted an official stance against the Vietnam War, connecting their struggle for liberation at home to the struggle of liberation for Vietnamese people. Here is an excerpt from their statement:\n\n\"We believe the United States government has been deceptive in its claims of concern for the freedom of the Vietnamese people, just as the government has been deceptive in claiming concern for the freedom of colored people in other countries as the Dominican Republic, the Congo, South Africa, Rhodesia, and in the United States itself.\n\n...We question, then, the ability and even the desire of the United States government to guarantee free elections abroad. We maintain that our country's cry of 'preserve freedom in the world' is a hypocritical mask, behind which it squashes liberation movements which are not bound, and refuse to be bound, by the expediencies of United States cold war policies.\n\n...We recoil with horror at the inconsistency of a supposedly \"free\" society where responsibility to freedom is equated with the responsibility to lend oneself to military aggression...We ask, where is the draft for the freedom fight in the United States?\"",

When a striking worker was shot and killed, Ettor and Giovannitti were arrested as accomplices to the murder on little to no evidence.\n\nWhile in jail, he wrote many poems, \"The Walker\" in particular becoming well-known. The trial made the textile strike a national controversy and resulted in \"Big Bill\" Haywood and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn coming in to lead the strike in their stead. Months after the strike itself ended, Ettor, Giovannitti, and a third co-defendant were acquitted of all charges.",

During their two-day, twenty-mile march, the men burned five plantation houses (three completely), several sugarhouses, and crops, armed with little more than hand tools.\n\nThe revolt ended when white planters, aided by Native American trackers, captured and executed Charles Deslondes (suspected leader of the revolt).

His school eschewed punishments and rewards, and encouraged practical experience over academic study.\n\nIn mid-1909, Ferrer was arrested and accused of orchestrating a week of insurrection known as Barcelona's \"Tragic Week\". He was convicted in a show trial and executed by firing squad on October 13th, 1909. His death triggered international outcry, and his life was prominently memorialized in writing, monuments, and demonstrations across three continents.",

It was led by the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and united immigrant workers of over forty nationalities. Prompted by a two-hour pay cut corresponding to a new law shortening the workweek for women, the strike spread rapidly through the town, growing to more than twenty thousand workers and involving nearly every mill in Lawrence.\n\nNational attention to the strike greatly increased when two IWW leaders, \"Smiling Joe\" Ettor and Arturo Giovannitti, were arrested on fabricated charges related to the murder of a striking worker. Upon their arrest, \"Big Bill\" Haywood and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn took over leadership of the strike. They further sensationalized the condition of the striking workers by ostentatiously sending their hungry children to stay with families and supporters in New York City.\n\nStriking workers and families were brutalized by police. When authorities tried to prevent more children from leaving the city, the police attacked a crowd of parents and their children, causing one pregnant woman to miscarry. Growing national sympathy for the strikers finally led the mill owners to agree to worker demands, and the parties agreed on significant pay raises to return to work. Ettor and Giovannitti were in prison for months after the strike ended, but were eventually acquitted of all charges.",

        "description": "Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, born on this day in 1809, was a French politician, philosopher, and the founder of mutualist philosophy. He was the first person to declare himself an anarchist, using that term, and is widely regarded as one of the ideology's most influential theorists, sometimes called \"the father of anarchism\". He became a member of the French Parliament after the Revolution of 1848, whereafter he referred to himself as a federalist.\n\nProudhon favored workers' associations or co-operatives as well as individual worker and peasant possession over private ownership or the nationalization of land and workplaces. In \"The Confessions of a Revolutionary\", Proudhon asserted that \"Anarchy is Order Without Power\", the phrase which much later inspired in the view of some the anarchist circled-A symbol.\n\nIt is worth noting that, despite his egalitarian beliefs in other respects, Proudhon was an avowed sexist and anti-Semite. One notorious (unpublished) quote reads \"The Jew is the enemy of the human race. This race must be sent back to Asia, or exterminated.\" Proudhon also maintained that a woman's choice was to be \"courtesan or housekeeper\", stating that man is \"a father, a chief, a master: above all, a master\". Joseph D\u00e9jacque, a contemporary libertarian communist, told Proudhon to \"speak out against man's exploitation of woman\" or \"do not describe yourself as an anarchist\".\n\nProudhon also unsuccessfully tried to create a national bank, to be funded by what became an abortive attempt at an income tax on capitalists and shareholders. Similar in some respects to a credit union, it would have given interest-free loans.",

King is best known for advancing civil rights through nonviolence and civil disobedience, inspired by his Christian beliefs and the nonviolent activism of Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nOn October 14th, 1964, King won the Nobel Peace Prize for combating racial inequality through nonviolent resistance. In 1965, he helped organize the Selma to Montgomery marches. In his final years, he expanded his focus to include opposition towards poverty, capitalism, and the Vietnam War.\n\nFor his activism, he was the target of multiple assassination attempts, arrested 23 times, and surveilled and harassed by the police. In particular, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover harassed Dr. King by making him a target of COINTELPRO, a secret program where FBI agents spied on, infiltrated, and attempted to discredit \"subversive\" political movements.\n\nIn 1968, King and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference organized the \"Poor People's Campaign\" to address issues of economic justice. King traveled the country to assemble \"a multiracial army of the poor\" that would march on Washington to engage in nonviolent civil disobedience at the Capitol until Congress created an \"economic bill of rights\" for poor Americans.\n\nBefore the plans for the march could come to fruition, however, King was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee while supporting striking black sanitation workers. James Earl Rey was convicted for the murder, but speculation of government involvement has persisted for decades after his death.",

The uprising was forcibly put down by the Freikorps and, for their role in it, both Luxemberg and Liebknecht were tortured and summarily executed by the government forces on this day that year.\n\nKarl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg have since become celebrated martyrs of the German left. Since 1919, an annual Liebknecht-Luxemburg Demonstration has been held in Berlin, the world's largest funerary parade and the biggest meeting of the German left. The annual \"L-L Demo\" is held on the second Sunday in January. In 2016, 14,000 people attended the rally in Liebknecht's and Luxemburg's honor.",

The same year, the U.S. fought and won the Spanish-American War, acquiring Puerto Rico, Guam, the Philippines, and establishing economic control of Cuba via the Platt Amendment.\n\nIn 1993, the U.S. government issued an \"Apology Resolution\", acknowledging that \"the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii occurred with the active participation of agents and citizens of the United States and further acknowledges that the Native Hawaiian people never directly relinquished to the United States their claims to their inherent sovereignty as a people over their national lands\".",

Lumumba served as the first Prime Minister of the independent Democratic Republic of the Congo from June until September 1960 and played a significant role in the transformation of the Congo from a colony of Belgium into an independent republic.\n\nIdeologically an African nationalist and pan-Africanist, he led the Congolese National Movement (MNC) party from 1958 until his assassination, in a coup by Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mobutu. The coup occurred when Lumumba, facing armed rebellion and an occupation by Belgian forces, asked for support from the Soviet Union. This led to a government split between himself, President Joseph Kasa-Vubu, and military commander Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mobutu.\n\nOn December 1st, 1960, Lumumba was captured by Mobutu's forces and imprisoned. On January 17th, 1961, he and his associates were brutally beaten and tortured by Katangan and Belgian officers, and Lumumba was executed later that night. The execution was carried out with Belgian and U.S. assistance. Belgium formally apologized for its role in the assassination in 2002.\n\nOn Lumumba's legacy, his friend and colleague Thomas Kanza wrote the following:\n\n\"He lived as a free man, and an independent thinker. Everything he wrote, said and did was the product of someone who knew his vocation to be that of a liberator, and he represents for the Congo what Castro does for Cuba, Nasser for Egypt, Nkrumah for Ghana, Mao Tse-tung for China, and Lenin for Russia.\"",

Baburova was a member of the Russian anarchist group \"Autonomous Action\" and a student of journalism at Moscow State University. Markelov was a lawyer who defended left-wing political activists, anti-fascists, journalists, and victims of police violence.\n\nOn January 19th, 2009, Markelov gave a press conference where he fiercely denounced the early prison release of a Russian army officer, convicted for the abduction and murder of a Chechen girl. After finishing, a masked assailant shot him in the back of the head, killing him instantly. Baburova, who was covering the press conference, was shot and killed after trying to stop the shooter.\n\nIn May 2011, the shooter Nikita Tikhonov was sentenced to life imprisonment, and his partner Eugenia Khasis was sentenced to 18 years in prison. Russian military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer has speculated that the Russian government was involved, noting that Tikhonov's use of a pistol fitted with a silencer was atypical for the neo-Nazi movement, which usually used knives and homemade explosives to commit violence.",

Padilla himself got involved in these tensions when he wrote a scathing critique of a government bureaucrat's novel (Lisandro Otero's \"Pasi\u00f3n de Urbino\") while simultaneously giving high praise to the work of an open critic of Castro's revolution (Guillermo Cabrera Infante's \"Tres Triste Tigers\").\n\nPadilla was subsequently fired from his job, along with the editorial board that published his criticism. On March 20th, 1971, Heberto Padilla was arrested and jailed for his work, \"Fuera del juego\". One of the charges brought against Fuera del juego was Padilla's conception of history, where he described time as a circle, which was seen as counter-revolutionary.\n\nPadilla was released thirty-seven days after being imprisoned, and his incarceration brought international criticism from writers like Mario Vargas Llosa, Julio Cort\u00e1zar, Susan Sontag, and Jean-Paul Sartre. He moved to the United States in 1980 and remained there for the rest of his life.",

The goal of the conflict was to achieve independence from both Portuguese Guinea and Cape Verde.\n\nCabral was assassinated in 1973, about eight months before Guinea-Bissau's unilateral declaration of independence. Cabral's pan-Africanism and revolutionary socialism continues to be an inspiration for socialists and national independence movements worldwide.",

She was highly critical of the existing political system in Japan, which led her to call for an anarchism to exist in \"everyday practice\", namely that people should in various small ways seek routinely to undermine the kokutai (a sense of national body politic). It\u014d also translated anarchist writings into Japanese, including works of Emma Goldman.\n\nOn September 16th, 1923, It\u014d, \u014csugi, and his 6-year-old nephew Munekazu were arrested, strangled to death, and thrown into an abandoned well by a squad of military police known as the \"Kenpeitai\". The killing of such high-profile anarchists, together with a young child, became a national controversy known as the \"Amakasu Incident\" (named after the leader of the squad). Lt. Amakasu was arrested and sentenced to ten years in prison for the murders, however he was released after serving only three years.",

Gramsci wrote more than 30 notebooks and 3,000 pages of history and analysis during his imprisonment. His \"Prison Notebooks\" are considered a highly original contribution to 20th-century political theory.\n\nToday, Gramsci is perhaps best known for his concept of cultural hegemony, which describes how the state and ruling capitalist class use cultural institutions to maintain power in capitalist societies without resorting to force. Hegemonic culture promotes capitalist values and norms such that they become the \"common sense\" values of all and reinforce the status quo.",

Until his assassination in 1973, pan-African socialist Am\u00edlcar Cabral played a key role in the revolutionary activity of PAIGC.\n\nThe first act of the revolution took place on January 23rd, when PAIGC guerrillas attacked a Portuguese garrison in Tite, near the Corubal River, south of Bissau. Similar guerrilla actions quickly spread across the colony. PAIGC had few weapons - perhaps only one submachine gun and two pistols per group - and so they attacked Portuguese convoys to gain more weapons.\n\nThe war ended when Portugal, after the Carnation Revolution of 1974, granted independence to Guinea-Bissau, with Cape Verde's independence following a year later.",

Their target was Joaqu\u00edn Navarro, the general secretary of the transport union of the Comisiones Obreras, who at that time was leading a transport strike in Madrid. The attackers searched the office, found the eight remaining staff, and, discovering Navarro had departed earlier, decided to kill all present.\n\nTold to raise their \"little hands up high\", the remaining eight people present were lined up against a wall and shot, killing four people (the fifth victim was killed earlier) and injuring four more. One of the injured, Dolores Ruiz, was pregnant and lost her child as a result of the attack.\n\nThe assassinations took place within the wider context of far-right reaction to Spain's transition to constitutional democracy following the death of dictator Francisco Franco two years prior Intended to provoke a violent left-wing response that would provide legitimacy for a subsequent right-wing counter coup d'\u00e9tat, the massacre had an immediate opposite effect, generating mass popular revulsion of the far-right and accelerating the legalization of the long-banned Communist Party.\n\nThe trial took place in February 1980 and the defendants were sentenced to a total of 464 years in jail, however a number of them escaped custody and fled to South America. After more than 20 years on the run, one the perpetrators, Garc\u00eda Juli\u00e1, was arrested in Brazil in 2018. Juli\u00e1 was extradited to Spain in February 2020, and transferred to Soto del Real prison to serve the remainder of his sentence.",

The incident began when police searched the room of Miyashita Takichi, a young lumbermill employee, and found materials which could be used to construct bombs, concluding that there was a broader conspiracy to harm the imperial family.\n\nOn the basis of this plot, the Japanese government rounded up leftist activists from all over the country. 24 of the 26 defendants actually brought to trial were sentenced to death, despite the evidence against nearly all of them being circumstantial.\n\nPrior to his execution, K\u014dtoku Sh\u016bsui, etched this message on the wall of his cell: \"How has it come about that I have committed this grave crime? Today my trial is hidden from outside observers and I have even less liberty than previously to speak about these events. Perhaps in 100 years someone will speak out about them on my behalf.\"",

The Farm Labor Organizing Committee (FLOC) was founded in 1967 in Toledo, Ohio by Baldemar Velasquez.\n\nIn 1978, Velasquez planned an ambitious labor action, noting that Ohio tomato growers would be unable to recruit enough workers to see them through a long strike. That year, 2,000 FLOC members walked off their jobs in Ohio, demanding a guaranteed minimum wage, better housing, and medical care.\n\nWhile some growers were willing to negotiate, big canners such as the Campbell's and Nestle were unwilling to pay the higher prices which would accompany a unionized workforce. FLOC reacted by boycotting their products and marching 560 miles from Toledo, Ohio to Campbell's headquarters in Camden, New Jersey in a well-publicized protest.\n\nA resolution finally came in 1986 when FLOC, growers, and Campbell's announced a collective bargaining agreement which achieved union recognition and provided for wage increases, grievance resolution, health insurance, and committees to study pesticide safety, housing, health care, and day care issues.\n\nShortly thereafter, FLOC reached deals with Vlasic, Heinz, Dean Foods, and 23 of the largest cucumber growers in Ohio and Michigan.",

Sometime between 1922 and 1923, they also established a group called \"F\"utei-sha (Society of Malcontents)\", which Fumiko identified as a group for direct action against the government.\n\nThese activities soon brought Pak and Fumiko under government scrutiny. In September 1923, the Japenese government therefore made a number of arrests, mostly Koreans, on limited evidence, and among those arrested were Pak and Fumiko.\n\nAfter lengthy judicial proceedings, Fumiko and Pak were convicted of high treason for attempting to obtain bombs with the intention of killing the emperor or his son. They were both sentenced to life in prison, however Fukimo allegedly committed suicide in her cell in 1926.",

        "description": "Angela Yvonne Davis, born on this day in 1944, is a Marxist and feminist activist, prison abolitionist, philosopher, and educator. She is a professor emerita at the University of California, Santa Cruz.\n\nIdeologically a Marxist, Davis was a member of the Communist Party USA until 1991, after which she joined the breakaway \"Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism\". She is the author of over ten books, covering topics such as class, feminism, and the U.S. prison system.\n\nBorn to an African American family in Birmingham, Alabama, Davis studied French at Brandeis University and philosophy at the University of Frankfurt in West Germany. Back in the U.S., she joined the Communist Party and, as a Marxist feminist, involved herself in a range of leftist causes, including the second-wave feminist movement, the Black Panther Party, and the campaign against the Vietnam War.\n\nIn 1970, UCLA's governing Board of Regents soon fired her due to her Communist Party membership; after a court ruled this illegal, the university fired her again, this time for her use of inflammatory language.\n\nPraised by many Marxists and others on the left, Davis has received various awards, including the Lenin Peace Prize. Davis has been inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame. Davis was Time magazine's \"Woman of the Year\" for 1971 in its 2020 \"100 Women of the Year\" edition.\n\n\"I am no longer accepting the things I cannot change. I am changing the things I cannot accept.\" - Angela Davis",

He promoted collaboration among the different craft unions that comprised the AFL and supported collective bargaining to secure shorter hours and higher wages for laborers.\n\nAlthough Gompers began his career sympathetic to socialist and Georgist thought, he became increasingly conservative throughout his career, making \"peace\" with capitalist labor relations rather than seeking to abolish them. This led to a split in the labor movement, with the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) representing the more radical advocation of labor interests via industrial unionism.\n\nGompers successfully advocated for anti-immigrant and anti-socialist politics with the AFL's influence, supporting the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and the Spanish-Civil War, and cooperating with widespread government arrests of union leaders for the IWW's militant opposition to World War I.",

Due to his wounds, he could not leave the scene and was arrested there. On June 15th, Wilckens was murdered in prison by a member of the paramilitary \"Liga Patri\u00f3tica Argentina\".\n\nOn the assassination, Wilckens said \"It was not vengeance; I did not see in Varela a minor official. No, he was everything in Patagonia: governor, judge, executioner, and undertaker. I tried to hurt him as the naked symbol of a criminal system. But revenge is unworthy of an Anarchist!

As part of this process, in order to fight a typhus outbreak, the workers were forced to strip and bathe in gasoline, which killed any lice on their bodies. On the morning of January 28th, Torres refused to be bathed, instead, convincing thirty other Mexican women to get out and protest with her.\n\nWithin an hour, there were more than 200 women blocking the entrance to El Paso. By the end of the protest, the crowd was several thousand strong. They laid in front of trains and vehicles and refused to leave when threatened with guns by the police. Eventually, the riot was subdued and Torres was arrested for her role in starting it.\n\nDespite the energized protest, the noxious delousing continued, later with insecticides like DDT, for decades afterward.",

Members of the revolutionary Spartacus League were active in the uprising, and were trying to turn the strike into a full-fledged revolution.\n\nWorkers elected a council of 414 delegates, who issued a set of demands. These included an end to the war, amnesty for all political prisoners, the democratization of government, and more and better quality food.\n\nThe rebellion was quelled with considerable force from the state on February 3rd, who viewed the strike as a threat to the current order. Despite the initial failure of the strike, on November 9th the social-democratic German Revolution of 1918 took place. Emperor Wilhelm II was forced to abdicate his throne and flee the country; German elections were held in January the following year.",

It was led by the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and united immigrant workers of over forty nationalities. Prompted by a two-hour pay cut corresponding to a new law shortening the workweek for women, the strike spread rapidly through the town, growing to more than twenty thousand workers and involving nearly every mill in Lawrence.\n\nLoPizzo was a striking immigrant worker who was killed when, according to IWW literature, officer Oscar Benoit fired into a crowd of protesters who had been cornered and were being attacked by police. Anna LoPizzo was likely an assumed name; historian Ardis Cameron wrote \"relying on old-world practices and principles of collectivity, the immigrant community routinely 'swapped' names and falsified documents to evade 'impossible' laws and ensure mutual survival.\"\n\nAfter her death, two IWW leaders, \"Smiling Joe\" Ettor and Arturo Giovannitti, were arrested on fabricated charges related to the murder of a striking worker. Upon their arrest, \"Big Bill\" Haywood and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn took over leadership of the strike. They further sensationalized the condition of the striking workers by ostentatiously sending their hungry children to stay with families and supporters in New York City.\n\nThe Lawrence Strike was ultimately won by the IWW and strikers. Eugene V. Debs said this of the ordeal: \"The Victory at Lawrence was the most decisive and far-reaching ever won by organized labor.\"",

The protest, organized by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA), was in opposition to a state policy of internment without trial that was introduced in August of 1971.\n\nOn January 18th, 1972, Prime Minister of Northern Ireland Brian Faulkner banned all parades and marches in response to widespread civil unrest. The march was organized despite this order.\n\nOn the day of the protest, approximately 10,000-15,000 joined the march, however their path was blocked by British Army barriers. The protest descended into chaos, with British soldiers defying orders, chasing down protesters and attacking them indiscriminately. 26 people were shot, and 14 were killed. Many of the victims were shot while fleeing from the soldiers or attending to the wounded, while others were injured by shrapnel, rubber bullets, batons, or being ran down by army vehicles.\n\nThe soldiers were from the 1st Battalion Parachute Army, and had also participated in the Ballymurphy massacre several months prior. The events of Bloody Sunday greatly increased hostilities between Northern Ireland and the British government. Support for and recruitment by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) rose following the massacre.",

Fighting broke out between city police and workers, and labor leaders David Kirkwood and William Gallacher were beaten and taken into custody. During the riot, the sheriff of Lanarkshire called for military aid, and British troops, supported by six tanks, were moved to key points in Glasgow.\n\nKirkwood was found innocent after a photo surfaced of him being struck with a baton from behind by a policeman, however Gallacher served five months in prison.

The Justice Department said they could not offer him protection, and so Allen declined to speak out.\n\nDespite this, on the day before Allen planned to move out of state, he was assassinated on his own property. In 2011, the CBS program \"60 Minutes\" conducted a special on his murder which suggested that Allen was killed by Amite County Sheriff Daniel Jones. No one has been prosecuted for his murder.",

Ethnic store and businesses supported the strikers by accepting coupons in place of cash and the strikers boycotted stores that did not support the strike.\n\nStrikers were violently harassed by the police and community - with cops beating and arresting protesters and two strike leaders being kidnapped and taken out of town by unknown assailants. The strike ended on May 20th with workers not only winning the 48 hour work week, but a 15% wage increase as well.",

In 1948, he enrolled in Witwatersrand University in Johannesburg, South Africa but was expelled after one year there, following the rise of the Apartheid government.\n\nMondlane eventually came to the United States, enrolling at Oberlin College in Ohio at the age of 31 under a Phelps Stokes scholarship, graduating in 1953 with a degree in anthropology and sociology.\n\nMondlane later became an Assistant Professor of Anthropology at Syracuse University and helped develop the East African Studies Program there. In 1963, he resigned from his post at Syracuse to move to Tanzania, co-founding the Mozambican Liberation Front (FRELIMO) to fully engage in armed liberation struggle, receiving aid from both the Soviet Union and Maoist China.\n\nIn 1969, Mondlane was assassinated by a bomb planted in a book, sent to him at the FRELIMO Headquarters in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The killing remains unsolved to this day, although former Portuguese agent Oscar Cardoso claims that Casimiro Monteiro planted the bomb. FRELIMO went on to successfully win power and an independent Mozambique in 1975.",

During the first two decades of the 20th century, Haywood was involved in several important labor battles, including the Colorado Labor Wars, the Lawrence Textile Strike, and other textile strikes in Massachusetts and New Jersey.\n\nHaywood was an advocate of industrial unionism, a labor philosophy that favors organizing all workers in an industry under one union, regardless of the specific trade or skill level. He believed that workers of all ethnicities should be united, and favored direct action over political action.\n\nHaywood was renowned for leading strikes in times of crisis. When martial law was declared during the Lawrence Textile Strike, Haywood traveled to the strike and implemented many innovative tactics to help the workers involved. One such ploy was to conspicuously send the hungry children of striking workers to host families in other states, garnering good press for the working families.\n\nIn 1917, Big Bill Haywood was arrested for espionage, along with 164 other members of the IWW. He was convicted, and, while temporarily released from prison due to an appeal, fled to the Soviet Union, where he served as labor advisor to Vladimir Lenin and spent the rest of life.\n\n\"The mine owners did not find the gold, they did not mine the gold, they did not mill the gold, but by some weird alchemy all the gold belonged to them!\" - Big Bill Haywood",

This and the curbing of labor rights prompted the rest of the workers at La Canadenca to go on strike and demand the readmission of those sacked and wage increases.\n\nThe strike soon spread to other companies in the sector via the CNT's union for water, gas and electricity workers. The lack of electricity in the city affected transport, hampering the provision of supplies and paralyzing 70% of factories in the province of Barcelona.\n\nA state of war was declared by the government and over 3,000 workers were detained.

Dissatisfied workers in several unions began the strike to gain higher wages after two years of World War I wage controls. Government officials, the press, and much of the public viewed the strike as a radical attempt to subvert American institutions.\n\nDuring the strike, a cooperative body made up of rank and file workers from all the striking locals was formed, called the General Strike Committee. It acted as a \"virtual counter-government for the city\", accoridng to labor historian Jeremy Brecher. The committee organized to provide essential services for the people of Seattle during the work stoppage. A system of food distribution was also established, which distributed as many as 30,000 meals each day.\n\nArmy veterans created an alternative to the police in order to maintain order. A group called the \"Labor War Veteran's Guard\" forbade the use of force and did not carry weapons, and used \"persuasion only.\" Major General John F. Morrison, stationed in Seattle, claimed that he had never seen \"a city so quiet and orderly.\"\n\nImmediately following the general strike's end, the Socialist Party headquarters was raided by police, and thirty-nine IWW members were arrested as \"ringleaders of anarchy\" despite playing a marginal role in the strike's development.",

        "description": "On this day in 1949, anti-Francoist anarchist writer Miguel Garc\u00eda, along with 8 others, was sentenced to death by the fascist Spanish government. Garc\u00eda (1909 - 1980) was a member of the Tallion Action Group who militantly opposed Francisco Franco's fascism. His capture came during a brutal crackdown on political dissidents by Spanish security forces in October 1949.\n\nWell known writers and intellectuals, including Andre Breton, Albert Camus, Rene Char, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Ignazio Silone protested the planned executions. There was also support for the nine prisoners from the British Labour Party. For unknown reasons, four of the condemned men, including Garc\u00eda, had their sentences commuted to life imprisonment. The other five were executed on March 14th, 1952, in Barcelona.\n\nHere are the names and a brief description of the five executed men:\n\nPedro Adrover Font, aged 44, was a major figure in the Barcelona anarchist resistance who had once placed a bomb under a cathedral in order to assassinate Franco.\n\nSantiago Amir Gruanas (\"El Sheriff\"), aged 38, was a guide and member of the anarchist resistance who had helped shot-down British airmen, Jews, and French Resistance members from France into Spain.\n\nGines Urrea Pina, aged 56, was a veteran of the Spanish Civil War and advocated for launching a new period of armed resistance against Franco.\n\nJose Perez Pedrero, nicknamed \"Tragapanes\" (\"bread swallower\") because he was always hungry, was a miner and had been involved in many guerrilla operations with the anarchist resistance.\n\nJorge Pons Argiles, known as \"Tarantula\", was a farmer and, like Tragapanes, was involved with the guerrilla activities of the resistance.",

Claiming that \"urgent\" action was needed to \"bring the French labour market into the modern era\", Villepin's CPE package would allow employers to hire 18-26 year-olds on two year contracts and fire them without notice or explanation.\n\nIn response, student unions called for a week of meetings and mobilization, and for a national day of protest for the 7th February. The national protest continued beyond February 7th, however, and a national strike was called on March 28th (incidentally, the same day a million workers in the UK struck to defend their pensions).\n\nHundreds of thousands of workers went on strike, and three million people took to the streets all across the country. Unions were prepared to call another general strike when the French government finally gave in and withdrew the law.\n\nA similar law (the CNE), which applied to small businesses of fewer than 25 people, was eventually overturned in the courts in 2007.",

The IWW members, along with other radical labor groups, were often met with suppression (sometimes violent) from local governments and business leaders when trying to give speeches.\n\nThe San Diego ordinance directly targeted IWW members, whose street \"preaching\" was explicitly made illegal. The law was met with immediate civil disobedience by labor activists, and several were immediately arrested. Over five thousand IWW members came to San Diego to protest the free speech limitation, and the city's jail capacity was strained.\n\nVigilantes began transporting arrested IWW members to the county border and beat them, and one city official who opposed the ordinance was threatened with lynching. Police indiscriminately used fire hoses on crowds of protesters, including women and children. By the fall of 1912, the protest movement petered out and the Free Speech Fight in San Diego was lost.",

Because of his unrelenting radicalism, he spent 33 years of his life in prison, leading to the nickname \"l'enferm\u00e9\", or \"the locked-up one\".\n\nBlanquism is more of a revolutionary theory than an economic or social one; his thinking was chiefly concerned with how to achieve revolution. Unlike Karl Marx, Blanqui did not believe in the predominant role of the working class. Instead, he believed that revolution should be carried out by a small group of professional, dedicated revolutionaries who would establish a temporary dictatorship by force.",

The act declared remaining lands after allotment as \"surplus\" and available for sale, including to non-Natives.\n\nBetween 1887 and 1934, indigenous people lost control of about 100 million acres of land, or about two-thirds of the land base they held in 1887, as a result of the act. The loss of land and the break-up of traditional leadership of tribes had such devastating consequences that many scholars refer to the Dawes Act as one of the most destructive U.S. policies for indigenous people in history.",

        "description": "On this day in 2004, the first supermarket was looted in a series of escalating riots and peaceful demonstration by unemployed people, predominantly Roma, in Slovakia.\n\nThe protests were in response to welfare cuts by the Slovakian government. At the time, 51% Roma women and 72% Roma men were unemployed, a trend which can be traced back to liberalization policies after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In February 2004, the unemployed all over Slovakia received official notices from the government informing them of steep cuts to welfare benefits, and demonstrations broke out in the eastern parts of the country.\n\nThe reaction was a mix of peaceful demonstrations and outright rioting. Signs from protests read \"We want work, not food stamps\" and \"We've had enough of capitalism\", and were attended by some of the white ethnic majority.\n\nIn the largest police and military operation since 1989, over 2000 troops were mobilized and sent to the affected regions. On February 23rd, in Trebi\u0161ov (southeastern Slovakia), police attacked a Roma demonstration with teargas and, in the freezing February cold, water cannon. Early the next morning, around 240 policemen attacked a settlement the protesters were suspected to live in by about 80 people in the historical town of Levo\u010da.\n\nAlthough the protests failed to develop into a more substantive political movement, they had a lasting impact. Soon afterward, the government made important concessions, increasing activation benefits by 50%, introducing scholarships and various subsidies for pupils and students from poor families, and increasing funding for placement opportunities for the unemployed.",

By 1917, the state had deemed her an effective and dangerous radical anti-war agitator. Following Italy's entry into the war, both D'Andrea and her partner Armando Borghi were subjected to house arrest and legally confined for the duration of the war.\n\nIn 1922, she published her first book of poetry, \"Tormento\", which included a forward by Italian anarchist Errico Malatesta. A prominent free love advocate and noted anti-fascist, she fled Italy with the rise of fascism and emigrated to the United States.\n\nIn 1929, a second edition of \"Tormento\" was published, however the prints were immediately seized by the authorities, who charged that its words \"excited the spirits\" and inspired revolt.",

Earlier that year, flour prices had more than doubled, going from $5.67 a barrel to $12 a barrel. There were also rumors that only four weeks' worth of flour were left.\n\nAt the meeting, an orator initiated the riot by saying this to the gathered crowd: \"Fellow citizens! Mr. Hart has now 53,000 barrels of flour in his store; let us go and offer him eight dollars a barrel, and if he does not take it...\"\n\nHungry workers plundered private storerooms filled with sacks of hoarded flour and forty people were arrested. The riot was a sign of the impending financial crisis known as the Panic of 1837, that hit the American economy the following month.",

A private force of about 5,200, known as the \"Law and Order League\" and financially funded by Goodyear, were prepared to attack the striking workers during the labor action.\n\nThe Summit County Central Labor Council was able to convince the Law and Order League to not attack the striking workers and violence was averted. The Council also threatened a general strike if there were violent attacks on picketing workers, further dissuading anti-strike attacks. After a month of picketing, the workers won their terms.\n\nThe event took place during a period of intense labor organization among auto factory workers in Akron, Ohio from 1933 - 1936. This group of workers were among the earliest in U.S. history to implement the \"sit-down\" strike, which involved sitting down on the job and refusing to work as a bargaining measure.",

The strike quickly grew in proportion - just a few days after it began, more than 80% of the prison population were refusing to work.\n\nThe prison warden declared a \"general lockup\", which confined all prisoners to their cells, and claimed the strike was over.

        "description": "Susan B. Anthony, born on this day in 1820, was an American abolitionist and women's rights activist who played a pivotal role in the women's suffrage movement.\n\nBorn into a Quaker family committed to social equality, she collected anti-slavery petitions at the age of 17. In 1863, she, along with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, founded the Women's Loyal National League, which conducted the largest petition drive in United States history up to that time, collecting nearly 400,000 signatures in support of the abolition of slavery. In 1866, they founded the American Equal Rights Association, which campaigned against gender and racial discrimination.\n\nIn 1872, Anthony was arrested for voting in her hometown of Rochester, New York, and convicted of violating the Enforcement Act in a widely publicized trial. Although she refused to pay the fine, authorities declined to take further action.\n\nIn 1878, Anthony and Stanton arranged for Congress to be presented with an amendment giving women the right to vote. In 1920, it was eventually ratified as the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, colloquially known as the Susan B. Anthony Amendment.\n\n\"Organize, agitate, educate, must be our war cry.\" - Susan B. Anthony",

The New York Public Library selected \"Against Our Will\" as one of 100 most important books of the 20th century.\n\nBrownmiller was also a member of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in the 1960s, and volunteered for Freedom Summer in 1964, wherein she worked on voter registration in Meridian, Mississippi.",

They rode with other migrant workers in a pickup truck with a canvas-covered bed, huddling around a can of hot ashes and covering themselves in blankets to stay warm. Vel\u00e1squez led his first strike at the age of 12, helping pickers at his summer job win better wages.\n\nIn September 1967, Baldemar co-founded FLOC with his father to help migrant workers collectively bargain for better conditions. Through FLOC, Vel\u00e1squez helped organize strikes and a boycott against the Campbell Soup Company, as well as leading migrant workers on a 560 mile protest march from the union headquarters in Toledo, Ohio to Campbell's headquarters in Camden, New Jersey.\n\nAfter winning a collective bargaining agreement with Campbell's, growers began complaining that they could not compete with inexpensive Mexican produce. Vel\u00e1squez personally traveled to Mexico and successfully lobbied the Mexican unions to raise their wages and benefits, closing the gap in prices. In 1994, he was awarded the Order of the Aztec Eagle, the highest honor Mexico can bestow on a non-citizen.",

From these meetings arose what the Gestapo called the \"Red Orchestra\" resistance group. Beginning in 1940, the group was in contact with Soviet agents, trying to thwart the forthcoming German attack upon the Soviet Union. Fish-Harnack even sent the Soviets information about the forthcoming Operation Barbarossa.\n\nOn September 7th, Arvid Harnack and Mildred Fish-Harnack were arrested while on a weekend outing. She was executed on this day in 1943 by beheading. Her last words were purported to have been: \"Ich habe Deutschland auch so geliebt\" (\"I loved Germany so much as well\").

        "description": "On September 2nd, 1945, Ho Chi Minh had declared Vietnam independent of French colonial rule, which led to immediate war with France. In Vietnam's Proclamation of Independence, Ho Chi Minh quoted passages from America's Declaration of Independence, pointing out that the ideals expressed in that revolution were aligned with their own desire for freedom.\n\nOn this day in 1946, Ho Chi Minh wrote a letter to President Harry Truman, asking for assistance in supporting the Vietnamese independence movement. Truman did not respond, and the U.S. began meddling in Vietnamese affairs to undermine Ho Chi Minh's movement. Here is an excerpt from the letter:\n\n\"Our Vietnam people, as early as 1941, stood by the Allies' side and fought against the Japanese and their associates, the French colonialists. From 1941 to 1945 we fought bitterly, sustained by the patriotism of our fellow-countrymen and by the promises made by the Allies at [the summits in] Yalta, San Francisco and Potsdam.\n\n...The French aggression on a peace-loving people is a direct menace to world security. It implies the complicity, or at least, the connivance of the Great Democracies. The United Nations ought to keep their words. They ought to interfere to stop this unjust war, and to show that they mean to carry out in peace-time the principles for which they fought in war-time.\n\n...It is with this firm conviction that we request of the United States as guardians and champions of World Justice to take a decisive step in support of our independence. What we ask has been graciously granted to the Philippines. Like the Philippines our goal is full independence and full cooperation with the United States. We will do our best to make this independence and cooperation profitable to the whole world.\"",

Together with Seale, Newton created a ten-point program which laid out guidelines for how the African-American community could achieve liberation.\n\nIn the 1960s, under Newton's leadership, the Black Panther Party founded over 60 community support programs (renamed survival programs in 1971) including food banks, medical clinics, HIV support groups, sickle cell anemia tests, prison busing for families of inmates, legal advice seminars, clothing banks, housing co-ops, and their own ambulance service.\n\nThe most famous of these programs was the Free Breakfast for Children program which fed thousands of impoverished children daily during the early 1970s. Newton also co-founded the Black Panther newspaper service which became one of America's most widely distributed African-American newspapers. In 1967, he was involved in a shootout which led to the death of the police officer John Frey. Although arrested for the murder of Frey, the charges were eventually dismissed.\n\nDespite graduating from high school illiterate, he taught himself how to read by reading Plato's Republic, latering earning a Ph.D. in social philosophy from the University of California at Santa Cruz's History of Consciousness program in 1980. In 1989, he was murdered in Oakland, California by Tyrone Robinson, a member of the Black Guerrilla Family.\n\n\"Black Power is giving power to people who have not had power to determine their destiny.\" - Huey Newton",

Immediately after the firings, the union leadership ordered the strike, taking their respective trolley cars off the streets effective at 1:00 that afternoon.\n\nIn the following days, mobs of workers destroyed trolley property.

When the National Guard entered the city to provide protection for RTC, members of other unions throughout the city saw this as a clear signal that the city and state governments were uniting in favor of the companies against the unions and the entire city began a general strike.\n\nThe tactic was successful and RTC eventually agreed to a wage increase, the re-hiring of strikers within three months, and mediation of the initial 173 union-targeted firings.",

By declaring wide swaths of domestic territory as \"military zones\", the state could provide legal justification for forcibly removing people deemed a threat from them.\n\nUsing a broad interpretation of Executive Order 9066, Lieutenant General John L. DeWitt issued orders declaring areas of the western United States as zones of exclusion under the Executive Order. As a result, approximately 112,000 men, women, and children of Japanese ancestry were evicted from the West Coast of the United States and held in American concentration camps and other confinement sites across the country.\n\nAmericans of Italian and German ancestry were also targeted by these restrictions, including internment. 11,000 people of German ancestry were interned, as were 3,000 people of Italian ancestry, along with some Jewish refugees. It wasn't until 1990 that surviving internees began to receive individual redress payments and a letter of apology.",

The phrase \"feminine mystique\" was created by Friedan to illustrate the assumptions that women would be fulfilled from their housework, marriage, sexual lives, and children. Friedan sought to prove that housewives were unsatisfied but could not voice their feelings.\n\nDespite the undeniable importance of the book in feminist history, it has faced numerous criticisms. According to Kirsten Fermaglich and Lisa Fine, \"women of color - African American, Latina, Asian American and Native American women - were completely absent from Friedan's vision, as were white working-class and poor women.\" Some research that the book is predicated on was also later discovered to be fraudulent.",

Among the reforms the Second Republic passed were universal male suffrage and a guaranteed \"right to work\", provided by National Workshops which gave the unemployed with a source of income.\n\nThe protests of February 22nd were triggered by the banning of political banquets, legal means of criticizing the government and fundraising for political organizing. Incidentally, communist journalist Friedrich Engels was in Paris at the time and witnessed these banquets. After the ban, thousands flooded out onto the streets to protest against the \"Citizen King\" Louis Philippe and his chief minister Fran\u00e7ois Pierre Guillaume Guizot.\n\nShouting \"Down with Guizot\" and \"Long Live the Reform\", the crowds marched past Guizot's residence and erected barricades in the streets of Paris, where fighting broke out between the citizens and the Parisian municipal guards. French troops shot into the crowd, killing at least fifty-two people.\n\nIn the next few days, Guizot resigned and King Philippe fled the country. By February 26th, the Second Republic had been formed, with poet Alphonse de Lamartine acting as a de facto dictator over France for the next three months.\n\nThe Second Republic's governance would be tested in the \"June Days\" uprising, which Karl Marx identified as a conflict between petite bourgeoisie and the proletariat. The revolting workers were crushed by force (with over 4,000 insurgents being deported to Algeria) and the Second Republic continued until elected President Louis Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte dissolved the parliament in a coup in 1851.",

Du Bois, born on this day in 1868, was a seminal American intellectual, author, and socialist and civil rights activist who co-founded both the Niagara Movement and the NAACP. Du Bois grew up in a relatively tolerant and integrated community, and, after completing graduate work at the University of Berlin and Harvard, he became a professor of history, sociology, and economics at Atlanta University.\n\nDu Bois was a prolific author notable for his polemics against racism. Among his works are \"The Souls of Black Folk\", a collection of essays, and \"Black Reconstruction in America\", which challenged the prevailing orthodoxy that black people were responsible for the failures of the Reconstruction Era. Du Bois was also a Pan-Africanist and helped organize several Pan-African Congresses to fight for the independence of African colonies from European powers.\n\nDu Bois believed that capitalism was a primary cause of racism, and he was generally sympathetic to socialist causes throughout his life. Because of this, he was spied upon by the U.S. government, who eventually indicted him for acting as an agent of a foreign state while advocating for nuclear disarmament. Notably, the NAACP did not support Du Bois during his trial, which ultimately failed to convict him.\n\n\"The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line.\" - W.E.B. Du Bois",

Comerford and defended by celebrated attorney Clarence Darrow. The trial, which ran from May 10th to August 2nd, 1920, resulted in convictions for all of the defendants.\n\nLloyd received a sentence of from 1 to 5 years in prison but remained free on bail pending resolution of the appeal process. Though the appeals process was exhausted in 1922, Lloyd was no longer seen as a threatening advocate of communism by that date and his sentence was accordingly commuted.",

Like other outbreaks of violence in the South in the immediate postwar era, this incident involved military veterans who were unwilling to accept prevailing racial norms upon returning to their hometowns.\n\nIt began when a young white male clerk began harassing the black mother of WWII veteran James Stephenson. Stephenson and the clerk began to fight and the veteran threw the clerk through a window. He and his mother were arrested for disturbing the peace.\n\nThat night, a white mob began to gather outside of the black-owned businesses part of town, called \"Mink Slide\". Rumors were that Stephenson may be lynched, and an armed black crowd began to gather as well. Four policemen tried to enter Mink Slide, and, after refusing to heed commands to stop from the black community, were wounded by gunfire.\n\nThe next day, several officers stormed the district, firing randomly into buildings, stealing cash and goods, searching homes without warrants, and took any guns, rifles, and shotguns they could find. When the sweep was over, more than one hundred black people had been arrested, and about three hundred weapons from the black community had been confiscated.\n\nIn a highly publicized trial, lawyers from the NAACP managed to acquit 23 of 25 black people of attempted murder charges, and the remaining charges were dropped by prosecutors.",

Williams obtained a charter from the National Rifle Association and set up a rifle club to defend black people in Monroe from Ku Klux Klan, once driving them out of his neighborhood with gunfire.\n\nAfter allowing a white couple to take refuge in their home during race riots, the local police indicted Williams for kidnapping the couple, forcing him to flee the country and take up residence in Cuba as a guest of Fidel Castro. While there, he ran a radio program called \"Radio Free Dixie\" with Castro support. In 1966, Williams moved to China where he became a friend and advisor to Mao Zedong.\n\nIn 1969, he returned to the United States and was immediately arrested for fleeing the kidnapping charge, however all charges were dropped. Williams' book \"Negroes with Guns\" (1962) details his experience with violent racism and his disagreement with the non-violent wing of the civil rights movement. The text was widely influential; Black Panther Party founder Huey Newton was among those who cited it as an influence.",

Paul Manhart S.J. and ten other residents of the area were apprehended at gunpoint and taken hostage.\n\nThe rebellion followed the failure of an effort of the Oglala Sioux Civil Rights Organization (OSCRO) to impeach tribal president Richard Wilson, whom they accused of corruption and abuse of opponents. Additionally, the rebels criticized the United States government's failure to fulfill treaties with Native American people and demanded the reopening of treaty negotiations.\n\nThe activists chose the site of the 1890 Wounded Knee Massacre for its symbolic value, and the town was promptly surrounded by nearly one thousand federal agents. Tribal leaders called off the occupation after 71 days, due to the death of a young Lakota man by U.S. sniper fire. The terms of ending the occuption included a mandated meeting at Chief Fools Crow's land to discuss reinstating an 1868 Treaty.",

The case is known as National Labor Relations Board v. Fansteel Metallurgical Corporation.\n\nIn the late 1930s, sit-down strikes had become prevalent in the auto industry and were particularly effective at winning worker demands. In a sit-down strike, workers stay by their station in the factory but refuse to work it. Factory management was usually reluctant to try and force workers out of the factory for fear of damaging expensive machinery, and often capitulated to them.\n\nOn February 17th, 1937, workers frustrated by failed attempts at getting Fansteel to recognize their union announced a sit-down strike and seized a portion of their factory. The employer won an injunction ordering the union men to vacate the premises, which they ignored, but were ultimately forced out. The NLRB held on March 14th, 1938, that Fansteel had to reinstate 90 of the workers because the company had violated the law first (precipitating the sit-down strike). Fansteel sued the government in response, but lost in National Labor Relations Board v. Fansteel Metallurgical Corporation.",

In 1910, he was elected as the first Socialist to the U.S. House of Representatives, representing a district in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nIn 1919, Berger was convicted of violating the Espionage Act for publicizing his anti-interventionist views and as a result was denied the seat to which he had been twice elected in the House of Representatives. The verdict was eventually overturned by the Supreme Court in 1921, and Berger was elected to three successive terms in the 1920s.",

It was also the last major revolt against the Bolshevik government on Russian territory during the civil war.\n\nThe rebellion took place in the context of a difficult winter in which fuel and food became scarce. Protests and civil unrest were happening throughout Russia, and the sailors in Kronstadt had actually deposed their commander Raskolnikov in late January.\n\nOn February 28th, in reaction to government suppression of protests in Petrograd, the sailors drafted a set of fifteen demands, including free elections, freedom of assembly for peasant and labor organizations, and the allowance of trade.\n\nOn March 2nd, a Provisional Revolutionary Committee was formed, demanding a \"third revolution\" to restore the revolutionary values Kronstadt supporters felt the Bolsheviks had betrayed.\n\nThe Bolsheviks accused the Kronstadt rebels as being \"counter-revolutionary\" and moved to crush the rebellion by force. On March 7th, the Bolshevik government began attacking the island with small land forces and aerial bombardment, however little progress was made.\n\nOn March 16th, a Bolshevik force of 50,000 met and defeated the 15,000 rebels, seizing control of the island. 8,000 Kronstadt refugees crossed into Finland within a day of Kronstadt's fall, sabotaging the defenses as they left.\n\nAnarchists see the Kronstadt Rebellion as a righteous rebellion against an increasingly repressive Soviet state, while Bolsheviks view it as counter-revolutionary and petty bourgeois in character. For his part, Lenin regarded the episode as a critical challenge to the revolution, calling Kronstadt \"undoubtedly more dangerous than Denikin, Yudenich, and Kolchak combined\".",

On April 9th in East St. Louis, eight deputies guarding a freight train shot into a crowd of strikers, killing six bystanders. The crowd responsed by setting the rail yards on fire.\n\nAfter two months of protest, the strike was called off on May 4th without the workers winning their demands.

Colvin was charged with disturbing the peace, violating the segregation laws, and battering and assaulting a police officer.\n\nParks was deliberately chosen by the NAACP as a more respectable person to predicate the struggle for civil rights on. She was married, employed, and worked as a secretary of the local chapter of the NAACP.\n\nColvin, however, was an unmarried teenager at the time and rumored to be pregnant by a married man. On Colvin's case, Parks stated \"If the white press got ahold of that information, they would have [had] a field day. They'd call her a bad girl, and her case wouldn't have a chance.\"\n\nColvin left Montgomery for New York City in 1958 because she had difficulty finding and keeping work following her participation in the federal court case that overturned bus segregation (similarly, Rosa Parks left Montgomery for Detroit in 1957). Colvin stated she was branded a troublemaker by many in her community. She withdrew from college and went on to become a nurse in Manhattan.\n\nOn her act of defiance that day, Colvin stated \"History kept me stuck to my seat. I felt the hand of Harriet Tubman pushing down on one shoulder and Sojourner Truth pushing down on the other.\"",

It required the enrollment of every male citizen and those immigrants (aliens) who had filed for citizenship, between 20 and 45 years of age, unless exempted by the Act.\n\nIn protest of the law, a \"Song of the Conscripts\" was written, distributed later at the 1863 New York City Draft Riots. One verse reads:\n\n\"We are coming, Father Abraham, three hundred thousand more,\n\nWe leave our homes and firesides with bleeding hearts and sore,\n\nSince poverty has been our crime, we bow to thy decree,\n\nWe are the poor who have no wealth to purchase liberty\"",

Up to 100 youths attended these meetings at various times, engaging in political debates and cultural discussions.

The attempted arson was not successful and the exhibition was re-opened the following day. Nine days later, the Gestapo arrested an unspecified number of Jews and incarcerated them in the internment camp at the Lewetzowstrasse Synagogue.\n\nOn March 6th, 1943, nine captured members were executed: Heinz Rotholz (1922\u20131943), Heinz Birnbaum (1920\u20131943), Hella Hirsch (1921\u20131943), Hanni Meyer (1921\u20131943), Marianne Joachim (1922\u20131943), Lothar Salinger (1920\u20131943), Helmut Neumann (1922\u20131943), Hildegard L\u00f6wy, and Siegbert Rotholz (1922\u20131943).

Their aim was the establishment of an independent Irish Republic by force of arms.\n\nIn 1865, the Fenians began preparing for a rebellion, collecting about 6,000 firearms and as many as 50,000 men willing to fight for Irish independence. The uprising began on February 14th, when Fenians attacked a coastguard station, robbed a man's house and stole his horses, and killed one policeman in County Kerry, however they retreated after discovering Killarney was occupied by the British Army.\n\nThe main rebellion took place on March 5th, when uprising took place in Dublin, Cork City and Limerick. Twelve people were killed, and the attempted revolution failed, in part to poor planning by the Irish and competent surveillance and suppression by the British government.\n\nThe Irish Republicans had declared a briefly lived provisional government during the rebellion. Here is an excerpt from their declaration:\n\n\"We have suffered centuries of outrage, enforced poverty, and bitter misery. Our rights and liberties have been trampled on by an alien aristocracy, who treating us as foes, usurped our lands, and drew away from our unfortunate country all material riches.\n\nThe real owners of the soil were removed to make room for cattle, and driven across the ocean to seek the means of living, and the political rights denied to them at home, while our men of thought and action were condemned to loss of life and liberty.

She was captured and summarily executed by the Freikorps, government-sponsored paramilitary groups consisting mostly of World War I veterans. Her body was thrown in the Landwehr Canal in Berlin.\n\nDue to her pointed criticism of both Leninist and more moderate social democratic schools of socialism, Luxemburg's legacy is a revolutionary school of socialist thought that exists outside of either tradition.\n\n\"Without general elections, without freedom of the press, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, without the free battle of opinions, life in every public institution withers away, becomes a caricature of itself, and bureaucracy rises as the only deciding factor.\" - Rosa Luxemburg",

Opposition to the strike was led by the Conservative government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who wanted to reduce the power of the trade unions.\n\nThe strike was ruled illegal in September 1984, as no national ballot of NUM members had been held, and the labor action failed on March 3rd, 1985. It was a defining moment in British industrial relations, with NUM's defeat significantly weakening the trade union movement and providing a major victory for Thatcher and the Conservative Party.\n\nThe number of strikes fell sharply in 1985, and all of Britain's working pits were closed in the following three decades. Poverty significantly increased in former coal mining areas; in 1994, Grimethorpe in South Yorkshire was the poorest settlement in the country.",

She graduated from medical training for paramedics and housewives the day before the German invasion of the Soviet Union. During fighting in her hometown, a wounded Soviet soldier she had been taking care of asked her why the city didn't have a strong partisan movement.\n\nWhen the soldier recovered, Kislyak contacted several partisans hiding out in a nearby forest and asked if she could join their cause, recruiting several acquaintances into the movement. With this organization, she helped kill Nazi officers, sometimes flirting with them to lure them into an isolated area where they could be killed out of sight.\n\nWhen she received word that a Gestapo agent nicknamed \"the Butcher\" would be coming to Kharkiv, she and her partisan unit spent two days planning his capture. Kislyak rented a room right next to his at the farm he was staying at.\n\nAfter courting him for a few days she lured him to a riverbank, where her conspirators captured him. After interrogating the officer, the group summarily executed him with a crowbar.\n\nIn response, more than one hundred villagers, including Mariya, were collectively arrested by the Gestapo and told they would be killed by a firing squad if the SS man wasn't found alive soon. After the plot became known, Mariya and two others were brutally tortured and interrogated for weeks.\n\nOn June 18th, the group of three was hanged and their bodies put on public display. On May 8th, 1965 she was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union.",

The several hundred protesters were making their first of three attempts to complete the march, which was 54 miles long.\n\nThe march had gone according to plan until protesters crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge, where they encountered a wall of state troopers and county posse waiting for them on the other side. Earlier that day, County Sheriff Jim Clark had ordered all white men in Dallas County over the age of twenty-one to report to the courthouse that morning to be deputized.\n\nThe police began assaulting the demonstrators, knocking many to the ground and beating them with nightsticks. Another detachment of troopers fired tear gas, and mounted troopers charged the crowd on horseback. One marcher, a fourteen year old girl, required 28 stiches in the back of her head.\n\nThis assault ended the first attempt of protesters to march to Montgomery, but it brought international attention to the protest. On March 21st, a third attempt was made to march to Montgomery, this one successful and culminating in 25,000 people arriving at the state capitol building.\n\nThe protest was a watershed moment in the civil rights struggle. By the next year, 11,000 black people successfully registered to vote in Selma, up from just 130.",

One of her last appearances was a speech to striking workers at International Harvester in February 1941, at approximately 90 years old.\n\nParsons was prescient on the nature of labor conflict, stating \"My conception of the strike of the future is not to strike and go out and starve, but to strike and remain in, and take possession of the necessary property of production\", anticipating the labor tactics of sit-down strikes and worker occupations.",

The first major protest of the February Revolution occurred on March 3rd when workers at Petrograd's largest industrial plant, the Putilov Factory, announced a strike to demonstrate against the government.\n\nOn March 8th, the strikers were joined by workers celebrating International Women's Day and protesting food rations, who recruited more than 50,000 workers from other plants. By March 10th, nearly all industry was shut down due to at least 250,000 workers participating in anti-government protests.\n\nOn March 12th, the majority of the city garrison joined the protesters, who seized Petrograd and began hunting police and shooting city officials. Despite a senior government official warning Nicholas II that \"any procrastination [in addressing the protests] is tantamount to death\", Nicholas responded \"again, this fat [official] has written me lots of nonsense, to which I shall not even deign to reply\". He was forced to abdicate the throne three days later.\n\nPower was then shared by the Petrograd Soviet and a Provisional Government (formed by the Provisional Committee of the State Duma, a representational branch of the previous government), declared on March 16th.\n\nThe relationship proved untenable, however (Lenin, for example, insisted on offering no support to the Provisional Government), and ultimately the \"dual power\" wielding regime was overthrown by the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution.",

Members of the raid mailed these documents anonymously to several U.S. newspapers, most of which refused to publish the information. The Washington Post was the first newspaper willing to publish the story.\n\nThe documents detailed widespread illegal surveillance on civil rights activists and contained some of the FBI's most self-incriminating documents, including several that detailed the FBI's use of postal workers and switchboard operators to spy on black civil rights activists.\n\nNoam Chomsky stated that analysis of the stolen documents show that 40% of them were devoted to political surveillance, including two cases involving right-wing groups, ten concerning immigrants, and over two hundred on left or liberal groups. Notably, Muhammed Ali, whose 1971 fight with Joe Frazier provided cover for the burglary, was himself a target of this surveillance.\n\nThe perpetrators were never caught. Over 40 years after the break-in, some participants decided to go public with their story. In 2014, Betty Medsger's book \"The Burglary: The Discovery of J. Edgar Hoover's Secret F.B.I.\" was released, which contains the burglars' description of the burglary and revealed the identities of five of the eight burglars.

The slogan \"Bread and Roses\" emerged from the protest, with bread symbolizing economic security and roses for better living standards.\n\nInternational Women's Day in 1917 was also the date of the Russian February Revolution, in which workers celebrating International Women's Day joined protests and riots against food rationing, with more than 50,000 people in the streets.

By the late 1950s, U.S. financial interests owned 90% of Cuban mines, 80% of its public utilities, 50% of its railways, 40% of its sugar production and 25% of its bank deposits, approximately $1 billion in total assets.\n\nWhen asked to analyze Batista's government, historian Arthur Schlesinger wrote \"The corruption of the Government, the brutality of the police, the government's indifference to the needs of the people for education, medical care, housing, for social justice and economic justice...is an open invitation to revolution.\"\n\nAccordingly, Batista's reign ended on January 1st, 1959 when he was ousted from power by communist revolutionaries. Early that morning, Batista fled with an estimated personal fortune of $300 million to the Dominican Republic, where strongman and previous military ally Rafael Trujillo held power. Batista eventually found political asylum in Oliveira Salazar's Portugal and Francisco Franco's Spain, dying in the latter in 1973.",

This was the second-worst mining disaster in history, surpassed only by the Benxihu Colliery accident in China on April 26th, 1942, which killed 1,549 miners.\n\nThe majority of the deaths and destruction were caused by an explosion of coal dust, which swept through the mine, however the cause of the explosion is not known. Around 500 miners were able to get to the surface in the hours after the explosion, however survivors trapped underground were found as late as April 4th.\n\nOn the incident, socialist politician Jean Jaur\u00e8s wrote \"It is a call for social justice that comes to the nation's representants from the depths of the burning mines. It is the harsh and suffering destiny of work that, once more, manifests itself to all. And would political action be something else than the sad game of ambitions and vanities if it didn't propose to itself the liberation of the workers' people, the organisation of a better life for those who work?\".",

Gertner recruited other women to join the conspiracy and passed the stolen gunpowder to Roza.\n\nOn October 7th, 1944, the Sonderkommando blew up Crematorium IV, but the revolt was quickly quelled by armed SS guards. A lengthy investigation led the Nazis back to Gertner and Roza, and then to Estusia Wajcblum and Regina Safirsztajn, who were also implicated in the conspiracy. They were interrogated and tortured for weeks.\n\nGertner, along with three co-conspirators, were executed on January 5th or 6th (sources differ) in 1945.

Vassev was persecuted for this work, serving time in prison and having to assume a fake identity (he was born Jordan Sotirov, and adopted the name Manol Vassev to escape the authorities). He was also active in the resistance during World War II.\n\nHe was arrested by the Communist for the first time on March 10th, 1945, along with all the delegates to the national conference of the Anarchist Communist Federation at Kniajevo, near Sofia. He was interned at the concentration camp of Dupnitsa and then at Kutzian.\n\nAfter serving five years in prison, a trial was held for a second sentence. Held in public, Vassev was accused of being an \"agent in the pay of the Anglo-Americans\". He interrupted the accusation, stating \"It isn't me who signed the Teheran and Yalta treaties with the English and the Americans; it's not me who went to London to kiss the skirt of the Queen of England!\"\n\nHe died the day before his release was scheduled, poisoned by the Bulgarian secret police.",

In addition, laws guaranteeing equal pay for equal work for women were passed, and mothers were guaranteed three months' maternity leave.\n\nThe government suspended the constitution of the previous regime, ruling by decree until a factional conflict broke out within the government which ultimately led to Maurice Bishop's execution.

The two mutineers had planned to take political refuge in Cambodia, however Prince Sihanouk had just been deposed by a coup the led by the pro-U.S. Sirik Matak and Lon Nol. Instead, they became prisoners of the new Cambodian government.\n\nOne mutineer, Alvin Glatkowski, turned himself in at an American Embassy, was extradited to the U.S., and served seven years in prison. The other mutineer, Clyde McKay, escaped capture and sought out the Khmer Rouge regime, and was never found. Remains from Cambodia were positively identified as his in 2005.",

The event was a war crime and suppressed by the U.S. military despite multiple whistleblowers coming forward. Estimates of the total killed range between 347 and 504.\n\nDespite two soldiers writing letters to their superiors about the possibility of a war crime having taken place, the U.S. government claimed that the event was a military victory for several months after it occurred. It was only after an independent journalist broke the story and the true nature of the massacre became public that twenty-six soldiers were charged with criminal offenses.\n\nOnly one, Lieutenant William Calley Jr., was convicted. Found guilty of killing 22 villagers, he was originally given a life sentence, but served only three and a half years under house arrest. The incident sparked global outrage and spurred the domestic anti-war movement. Three U.S. servicemen who had tried to halt the massacre and rescue the hiding civilians were shunned and denounced as traitors, including by multiple U.S. Congressmen.",

A few months after it was formed, the commune was attacked and defeated by the French National Army on May 21st, 1871, beginning the so-called \"Bloody Week\".\n\nThe government of the Paris Commune developed a set of policies that tended towards a progressive, secular, and highly democratic social democracy, although its existence was too brief to implement these ideas. Among these policies were the separation of church and state, abolition of child labor, abolishment of interest on some forms of debt, as well as the right of employees to take over and run an enterprise if it was deserted by its original owner.\n\nThe Paris Commune was analyzed by many communist thinkers, including Karl Marx, who called it a \"dictatorship of the proletariat.\" Vladimir Lenin danced in the snow in celebration when the newly formed Bolshevik government lasted longer than the Paris Commune. It inspired similar revolutionary attempts around the world, including communes in Moscow (1905), Petrograd (1917), Shanghai (1927 and 1967), and Seattle (2020).",

Blackwell was also a project director for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and helped organize voter drives for African Americans across Mississippi.\n\nBlackwell was responsible for one of the first desegregation cases in Mississippi, filing a suit, Blackwell v. Issaquena County Board of Education, against the Issaquena County Board of Education after the principal suspended more than 300 black children - including her son - for wearing pins that depicted a black hand and a white hand clasped with the word \"SNCC\" below them. Although the courts ruled that the students could not wear the pins, they also ruled that the school district in question must desegregate.\n\nBlackwell's son and approximately 50 other children boycotted the school because of its decision to not let the children wear the SNCC freedom pins. As a result, Blackwell and some other activists in the community formed \"Freedom Schools\" in Issaquena County to resolve the issue. The Freedom Schools were popular and remained open until the school system finally integrated in 1970.\n\n\"Movements are not radical. Movements are the American way. A small group of abolitionists writing and speaking eventually led to the end of slavery. A few stirred-up women brought about women's voting. The Populist movement, the Progressive movement, the anti-Vietnam War movement, the women's movement - the examples go on and on of 'little people' getting together and telling the truth about their lives. They made our government act.\" - Unita Blackwell",

Ilocanos are the third largest Filipino ethnolinguistic group, mostly residing within the Ilocos Region in northwestern Philippines.\n\nAfter the capture of Manila by the British, her husband Diego Silang (1730 - 1763) sought to initiate an armed struggle to overthrow the Spanish colonizers in Ilocos and replace them with native-born officials. Notably, they co-operated with the British in this effort, who appointed Diego governor of the Ilocos region on their behalf.\n\nGabriela took over the reins of her husband's revolutionary movement after his assassination in 1763, leading the Ilocano rebels for four months before being captured and executed on September 20th that year by the colonial government of the Spanish East Indies.",

While studying there, Jingyu read many of Marx's works and became a communist. In 1923, Xiang Jingyu was elected as a Central Committee member and became the first secretary of the \"Women's Movement Committee\".\n\nIn 1924, she led a strike involving about 10,000 female workers from silk factories and later founded the \"Committee of Women's Liberation\", which trained many female cadres to oppose feudalism and imperialism.\n\nOn March 20th, 1928, Xiang Jingyu was arrested in the French Concession Sandeli in Wuhan, possibly due to the betrayal of members of her group to the police. The French officials turned her over to Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist government in April. On May 1st, 1928, Xiang Jingyu was executed by Guomindang police. After her death, she became a martyr for the communist revolution in China.",

By highlighting racial injustice, they contributed to the passage of the Voting Rights Act that year, a landmark federal achievement of the civil rights movement.\n\nThe first attempt to make the march happened on March 7th, but failed due to police brutality. Police knocked marchers to the ground, beat them with nightsticks, and fired teargas. One marcher, a 14 year old girl, required 28 stitches in the back of her head. Although the assault ended the first attempt of protesters to march to Montgomery, it brought international attention to the protest.\n\nAfter a federal court ruled that the march was legal, the third and successful attempt to march to Montgomery was made. By its end, 25,000 people marched to steps of the State Capitol Building in Montgomery. The protest was a watershed moment in the civil rights struggle, and, by the next year, 11,000 black people were successfully registered to vote in Selma.",

More than 20,000 protesters showed up at the police station in opposition to apartheid.\n\nThe unarmed crowd was met with armored police armed with Sten submachine guns and Lee\u2013Enfield rifles. After F-86 Sabre jets and Harvard Trainers flew low over the crowd, within a hundred feet of the ground, in an attempt to scatter it, the crowd began throwing rocks at police.\n\nThe police responded by opening fire on the crowd, killing 69 people and injuring 180 others. 29 children were casualties of the violence, and many people were shot in the back as they fled.\n\nA storm of international protest followed the Sharpeville shootings, including sympathetic demonstrations in many countries and condemnation from the United Nations. Sharpeville marked a turning point in South Africa's history; the country found itself increasingly isolated in the international community.\n\nThe Sharpeville massacre contributed to the banning of the PAC and ANC as illegal organizations. The massacre was one of the catalysts for a shift from passive resistance to armed resistance by both of these groups.",

Approximately 300 were determined to be security risks and fired.\n\nIt established a wide domain for the departmental loyalty boards to conduct screenings of federal employees and job applicants, allowing the FBI to run initial name checks on federal employees and authorize further field investigations if the initial inquiry uncovered information that cast someone in a negative light.\n\nExecutive Order 9835 also was the main impetus for the creation of the Attorney General's List of Subversive Organizations (AGLOSO). It was later revoked by Eisenhower in 1953, but only to further expand the restrictions in a new executive order (Executive Order 10450). Both executive orders were later repealed by President Bill Clinton (Executive Orders 12968 and 13087).",

His military career against the Spanish began in August 1896 with the Katipunan-led Philippine Revolution.\n\nAguinaldo would go on to lead Philippine forces against multiple colonizing forces - first against Spain in the Philippine Revolution (1896 - 1898), again in the Spanish-American War (1898), and finally against the United States during the Philippine-American War (1899-1901).\n\nAguinaldo was involved in multiple controversies as a government leader, most notably his role in the execution of Andr\u00e9s Bonifacio (1863 - 1897), the leader of the Katipunan group. Bonifacio was a prominent revolutionary and political dissident to Aguinaldo's authority. The trial in which he was convicted is now seen as dubious.\n\nAlthough Aguinaldo was the first president of an Asian constituional republic, this government was dissolved by invading U.S. forces, and he was forced to swear an oath of allegiance to the U.S. Aguinaldo was 77 when the United States finally recognized Philippine independence in the Treaty of Manila on July 4th, 1946, in accordance with the Tydings\u2013McDuffie Act of 1934.",

Yellow-dog contracts are binding agreements where employers ban workers from unionizing as part of the hiring process.\n\nThe title comes from the names of the sponsors of the legislation: Senator George W. Norris of Nebraska (shown left) and Representative Fiorello H. La Guardia of New York (shown right). The law helped mitigate decades of anti-union activity, enabled in part by the precedent of court cases like In re Debs (1895), which affirmed the right of the federal government to end the Pullman Strike with an injunction.\n\nThe Norris-La Guardia Act was a precursor to the sweeping National Labor Relations Act of 1935, which established the National Labor Relations Board and is considered one of the most important pieces of labor legislation in the 20th century United States.",

He led tense negotiations with Greece's creditors during the government-debt crisis, but failed to reach an agreement with the European troika (European Commission, European Central Bank, and International Monetary Fund), leading to the 2015 bailout referendum.\n\nThe referendum rejected the troika bailout terms, and the day afterwards Varoufakis resigned as Minister of Finance, being replaced by Euclid Tsakalotos. Varoufakis has since appeared in numerous debates, lectures and interviews, describing in detail what he sees as corruption and anti-democratic governance within the European Union.\n\nIn February 2016, he launched the Democracy in Europe Movement 2025 (DiEM25). In the 2019 legislative election, DiEM25 amassed nine parliamentary seats, with Varoufakis himself returning to the Hellenic Parliament. Today, it has 138,000 members around the world.

Although initially perceived as a conservative, Romero became an activist after the assassination of his friend and fellow priest Rutilio Grande in 1977.\n\nDuring the civil war, Romero was a prominent figure in El Salvador, giving popular radio sermons in which he reported disappearances, tortures, murders, and other repressed information each Sunday. In a media landscape that was heavily censored, Romero became an important source of news for what was going on in the country. According to listener surveys, 73% of the rural population and 47% of the urban listened regularly.\n\nIn 1980, Romero was assassinated while celebrating Mass in the chapel of the Hospital of Divine Providence, the day after he gave a sermon urging soldiers to listen to \"God's orders\" and desert their ranks rather than continuing to oppress the domestic population. Romero's funeral was interrupted by smoke bombs and rifle shots from surrounding buildings that were fired into the mourning crowd, killing dozens.\n\nIn 2000, The Guardian named Oscar Perez Linares as the assassin, using declassified CIA documents as evidence. Investigations by the UN-created Truth Commission for El Salvador concluded that the extreme right-wing politician and death squad leader Roberto D'Aubuisson had given the order to kill Romero. Both died before being brought to justice for their role in his death.\n\n\"A church that doesn't provoke any crises, a gospel that doesn't unsettle, a word of God that doesn't get under anyone's skin, a word of God that doesn't touch the real sin of the society in which it is being proclaimed\u2009\u2014\u2009\u200bwhat gospel is that?\" - \u00d3scar Romero",

The bombings lasted until June 10th of that year.\n\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) bombing campaign was its first military action taken without the endorsement of the U.N. Security Council. James Byron Bissett, former Canadian ambassador to Yugoslavia, called the campaing a \"war crime\", and Noam Chomsky referred to it as an act of \"terrorism\".\n\nSupporters for the campaign claimed the bombing was necessary to stop a genocide of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and to remove Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 from power, although claims made by the Clinton administration along these lines were later found to be highly exaggerated.\n\nApproximately 500 of the people killed were civilians, and the bombs damaged many civilian structures alongside legitimate military targets. Chomsky has argued that the main objective of the NATO intervention was to integrate Yugoslavia into the Western neoliberal social and economic system. In 2000, Michael Parenti authored \"To Kill a Nation: The Attack on Yugoslavia\", which argues that the bombing was predicated on capitalist rather than humanitarian interests.",

Most of the victims were recent Italian and Jewish immigrant women and girls aged 14 to 23.\n\nThe death toll was high in part because the doors to the stairwells and exits were locked (a then-common practice to prevent workers from taking unauthorized breaks and to reduce theft). The incident led to legislation requiring improved factory safety standards and helped spur the growth of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU), which fought for better working conditions for sweatshop workers.\n\nThe owners (who survived the fire by fleeing to the roof when it began), were acquitted of manslaughter charges, but found liable for wrongful death. Although they had to pay out $75 per victim killed, their insurance provider paid them out $400 per casualty. Two years later, one of the owners was arrested and fined $20 for again locking his doors during factory hours.",

        "description": "On this day in 1931, the Scottsboro Boys were falsely accused of raping white women after fending off a group of white attackers, leading to a national scandal involving lynch mobs, Supreme Court appeals, and the Communist Party.\n\nThe Scottsboro Boys were nine African American teenagers, ages 13 to 19, falsely accused in Alabama of raping two white women on a train. The accusers were a group of young white men who were fought off by the Scottsboro Boys after they attacked and tried to remove them from the train.\n\nThe landmark set of legal cases from this incident dealt with racism and the right to a fair trial, with the Supreme Court ruling that the state of Alabama had to let black people serve on the trial's jury. The controversies also included lynch mobs which formed before the suspects could even be indicted, rushed trials, and disruptive mobs. It is commonly cited as an example of a miscarriage of justice in the United States legal system.\n\nInitially, all but the youngest, 13 year old Roy Wright, were convicted of rape and sentenced to death. With help from the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the case was appealed to the Alabama Supreme Court, which affirmed seven of the eight convictions. The cases were then appealed twice to the United States Supreme Court, which ordered new trials due to the exclusion of black people from juries (Norris v. Alabama) and violation of due process (Powell v. Alabama).\n\nIn the subsequent re-trials, Creed Conyer was selected as the first black person since Reconstruction to sit on an Alabama grand jury. Despite the successful legal appeals, most of the Scottsboro Boys were convicted on charges of rape or sexual assault. The legal aid of the Communist Party impressed some poor black sharecroppers in the South, leading to increased black participation in the party there (Ned Cobb, Hosea Hudson, the Sharecroppers' Union).\n\nClarence Norris, the only defendant ultimately sentenced to death, \"jumped parole\" in 1946 and went into hiding. He was found in 1976 and pardoned by Governor George Wallace. Norris later wrote a book about his experiences, \"The Last of the Scottsboro Boys: An Autobiography\", and died in 1989, the last surviving defendant.",

This decision granted legal fishing rights to Native Americans in Washington state, and was used as legal precedent for other lawsuits that sought to restore rights granted in Native American treaties.\n\nFrom 1964 to 1967, he also served as executive director of the National Congress of American Indians, increasing tribal membership from 19 to 156. Beginning in 1977, Deloria was a board member of the National Museum of the American Indian, which now has buildings in both New York City and Washington, DC.\n\n\"Until America begins to build a moral record in her dealings with the Indian people she should not try to fool the rest of the world about her intentions on other continents.\" - Vine Deloria Jr.",

The act of rebellion began when at least three armed people climbed a high well and entered the guardhouse early in the morning of March 27th, 1993. They subdued the ten guards and locked them in a van near a landfill. After that, the RAF members brought in more than 200 kilograms of explosives, detonating them at 5:12 am. The prison had to be rebuilt, which took another four years, opening and receiving inmates in May 1997.\n\nThe bombing was the last major action of the RAF before they dissolved in 1998. In 2007, fourteen years later, detectives identified three perpetrators using DNA analysis, however all three suspects are still at large.

The incidents became known as the Bydgoszcz Events, and political tensions increased when the Polish government downplayed or outright denied being responsible the injuries sustained by the involved Solidarity members.\n\nSolidarity made several demands, including the immediate punishment of officials responsible for the Bydgoszcz incident, legal permission for peasants to form their own union, annulment of a government directive giving only half pay to strikers, and the closing of all pending cases against people arrested for political opposition to government policies between 1976 and 1980.\n\nIf no agreement between the government and Solidarity could be reached by March 31st, Solidarity planned to instigate a general strike. As a kind of \"warning shot\" to the state, nearly all Polish workers went on a 4-hour strike on March 27th, 1981. Workers set up guard around occupied factories, and people still on their job wore red and white armbands to express solidarity with those who were striking. During the four hours of protest, television screens in Poland showed the words \"Solidarity-Strike\"\n\nSolidarity and the Polish government came to an agreement after this episode, and the general strike planned for March 31st was averted. The government conceded to demands about police brutality and admitted mishandling the Bydgoszcz Events. In return, Solidarity leader Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa agreed to postpone the general strike.",

The bombing was a partial success, destroying 15% of the records, around 800,000 in total.\n\nFollowing the 1940 German invasion and occupation of the Netherlands, everyone aged 15 and older was required to carry an identification card, the \"persoonsbewijs\", with them at all times. Resistance members soon started to forge identification cards at a large scale \u2013 the largest such operation, led by sculptor Gerrit van der Veen, produced some 80,000 forged documents. Forged documents could be easily detected, however, because they could be compared against the records in the civil registries.\n\nDisguised in police uniforms, the resistance group approached the security guards and told them that they had come to search the building for explosives. Believing their story, the guards let them in. Two medical students then sedated the guards by injecting them with phenobarbital. While inside the building, the saboteurs then set the building on fire with a series of timed explosions.\n\nFollowing the bombing, the Nazis immediately offered a 10,000 guilder reward to whomever could identify the perpetrators of the assault. Within a week, most of the conspirators had been betrayed to the Nazis and arrested, including resistance leader and openly gay man Willem Arondeus, who was executed along with twelve others. Arondeus' last words were \"Tell the world that gays are no less courageous than anyone else.\"",

Chavez emphasized direct but nonviolent tactics, including pickets and boycotts, to pressure farm owners into granting strikers' demands. His campaigns used Catholic symbolism, including public processions, masses, and fasts.\n\nCh\u00e1vez would go on to play key roles in pivotal labor episodes such as the Delano Grape Strike and the Salinas Lettuce Strike. Although initially based in California, Ch\u00e1vez began expanding the UFW, trying to make it a national organization.\n\nViewing undocumented workers as an obstacle to successful organizing, in the 1970s, Chavez pushed a controversial \"Illegals Campaign\", using UFW union members to spy on and oust undocumented workers, alienating some of his allies in the process. Also interested in co-operatives as a form of organization, he established a remote commune in the foothills of the Tehachapi Mountains.\n\nA polarizing figure, UFW critics raised concerns about Chavez's firm personal control of the union, and farm-owners considered him a communist subversive. For many organized labor and leftist groups in the U.S., however, Ch\u00e1vez is an iconic labor leader and posthumously became a \"folk saint\" among Mexican Americans.\n\n\"The fight is never about grapes or lettuce. It is always about people.\" - C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez",

The strike marked the beginning of a period of open rebellion by workers against capitalists and the state wherein they released prisoners, burnt stockades to the ground, and held off convict scabs by force.\n\nOn July 14th, armed miners surrounded the stockades where leased convicts were held and sent them by train out of the city. After repeated attacks on mine property and the stockades where prison workers were kept, the miners burned the prison to the ground and freed hundreds of convicts being held there on October 31st.\n\nOn Nov. 2nd, a band of workers attacked a different set of stockades, freeing the prisoners detained there as well. From these two events alone, at least 453 convicts were set free.\n\nThe strike was forcibly put down by state militia, ending with the arrest of hundreds of miners. All but one were either acquitted or merely fined. Tennessee ended its policy of allowing convict labor to replace mine workers in 1892.",

The trial, which began on this day in 1918, was unusual in the way that the prosecution did not try to demonstrate the guilt of individuals, but rather to indict the IWW as an entire organization. During the trial, prosecutors read inflammatory passages from seized documents; accordingly, the defense testified about the plight of the working man and the evils of capitalism.\n\nAll defendants were found guilty on all charges brought by the prosecution, and many IWW members served several years in prison. Among those convicted was \"Big Bill\" Haywood, a prominent leader of the IWW, however he skipped bail before his sentencing and fled to the Soviet Union, where he would spend the rest of his life.",

In the speech, Malcolm X did not abandon electoralism entirely, but stated \"Don't be throwing out any ballots. A ballot is like a bullet. You don't throw your ballots until you see a target, and if that target is not within your reach, keep your ballot in your pocket\".\n\nHere is a brief excerpt from the speech:\n\n\"I went to a white school over here in Mason, Michigan. The white man made the mistake of letting me read his history books. He made the mistake of teaching me that Patrick Henry was a patriot, and George Washington - wasn't nothing non-violent about ol' Pat, or George Washington. 'Liberty or death' is was what brought about the freedom of whites in this country from the English.\n\nThis is why I say it's the ballot or the bullet. It's liberty or it's death. It's freedom for everybody or freedom for nobody.\n\n...\n\nA revolution is bloody, but America is in a unique position.

Initial agreed and USLAC, declaring victory, ended the sit-in.\n\nThe episode took place in a larger wave of economic justice activism on U.S. college campuses, spurred in large part by the global justice movement's spotlighting of corporate malfeasance in the United States and especially in the Global South. Some students in this period chose to campaign for living wages, unionization, and expanded benefits for their campuses' workers, who were often paid significantly less than other university staff.",

She was also the first African-American woman to work at a mainstream white-owned newspaper.\n\nCooke got her start when she was offered a job as assistant to W.E.B. Du Bois, then editor of the NAACP magazine \"The Crisis\". Du Bois had chosen her for this role on recognition of her writing talent alone - she had no prior experience or education in journalism. In 1926 moved to New York City, settling in Harlem during the Harlem Renaissance.\n\nTo highlight the exploitation of black domestic workers in white homes, she got herself hired along with others seeking work by the day and then described her experiences in a widely read series for the Daily Compass entitled \"The Bronx Slave Market\", in which she went into explicit detail about the exploitation of black domestic workers.\n\nLater in life, Cooke was an ardent advocate of Angela Davis. She began working with the Angela Davis Defense Committee in 1969 and volunteered as national legal defense secretary of the Angela Davis Defense Fund in 1971. She also coordinated committee activities in New York and raised money for Angela Davis's defense by organizing a rally at Madison Square Gardens attended by over 16,000 people.\n\n\"As I stood there waiting to be bought, I lived through a century of indignity...'I've always picked nice girls,' she said. 'I knew you were nice the minute I laid eyes on you.' That pat on the back was worse in a way than a kick in the teeth.\" - Marvel Cooke, in part four of \"The Bronx Slave Market\"",

The group was explicitly revolutionary, eschewing electoralism, and drew recruits from economically alienated youth. In 1970, Wijeweera was arrested following unruly anti-Vietnam War protests in front of the U.S embassy, and JVP launched the 1971 armed rebellion shortly afterward, while its founder was still imprisoned.\n\nThe revolt began on April 5th, 1971 and lasted until June of that year. The insurgents were able to capture and hold several towns and rural areas for several weeks until they were recaptured by the armed forces. The official death toll was listed as 1,200, however other accounts estimate the deaths to be around 4,000 - 5,000 people. The rebellion led to Ceylon severing ties with North Korea, which it accused of supporting the JVP.\n\nIn 1987, the JVP launched another armed rebellion, this one sustained for three years and involving guerrilla warfare and political assassinations. According to Dr. Rohan Gunaratna's research, in this second rebellion, the JVP killed approximately 200 people, including politicians, academics, and military officers, between 1987 and 1990. In contrast, the total death toll of 35,000 - 60,000 is mostly due to violence perpetrated by state-sponsored death squads.",

Some members of the crowd beat down the doors to the Colonial Building, and, when entering it, battled with police, both inside and outside the building.\n\nIn response, protesters began throwing objects through windows and attemped to set the Colonial Building on fire. Prime Minister Squires exited the building, but was found by the crowd, who assaulted him and forced him to take shelter at a private residence.\n\nSquires immediately resigned - while the riot was still going on - and called for new elections. His party, the Liberal Party, won only two seats, with the vast majority going to the United Newfoundland Party.

In the book, Herman and Chomsky argue that mass media of the U.S. effectively act as a massive propaganda campaign without overt coercion.\n\nAlthough that is their most famous co-authored work, they also authored \"Counter-Revolutionary Violence\" together in 1973. In it, they critique U.S. foreign policy in Indochina, with a significant focus on the Vietnam War. The book was heavily repressed domestically and led to the publisher, Warner Modular, being shuttered.\n\n\"The steady advance, and cultural power, of marketing and advertising has caused the displacement of a political public sphere by a depoliticized consumer culture.\" - Edward S.

Betances is considered to be the father of the Puerto Rican independence movement.\n\nBecause of his abolitionist beliefs, Betances began organizing a series of secret anti-slavery organizations in 1856. Some of these societies sought the freedom and free passage of maroons from Puerto Rico to countries without slavery, while other societies sought to liberate as many slaves as possible by buying out their freedom (this included freeing thousands of slaves as infants and baptizing them at the Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Candelaria).\n\nWhile exiled from Puerto Rico, Betances and others formed the \"Revolutionary Committee of Puerto Rico\" and began agitating for armed insurrection to establish Puerto Rican independence. The most famous attempt of these was the \"Grito de Lares\", however it was forcibly put down by the local militia.\n\nBetances was known for stating \"Nadie puede dar lo que no tiene\" (English: \"No one can give others what they don't have for themselves\") in reference to Spain's unwillingness to grant Puerto Rico or Cuba any reforms.\n\nDays before his death, the U.S. annexed Puerto Rico in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War. Frustrated by the ostensible unwillingness of Puerto Ricans to demand their independence from the United States, he wrote \"And what's wrong with Puerto Ricans that they haven't yet rebelled?\"",

After fleeing ~eleven miles north to Lebanon, they settled in Damascus, Syria as Palestinian refugees.\n\nIn 1969, after establishing himself as an author and journalist, he joined The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and, resigned from his post as editor for the magazine Al-Anwar to edit the PFLP's weekly magazine, al-Hadaf (\"The Goal\"). He drafted a PFLP program in which the movement officially took up Marxism-Leninism, a notable departure from pan-Arab nationalist ideology.\n\nOn July 8th, 1972, at the age of 36, Kanafani was assassinated via car bomb by the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad for his role in the PLFP, which claimed responsibility for the Lod Airport Massacre.\n\nThe massacre, committed by three members of the Japanese Red Army recruited by the PLFP, killed 26 people, injuring 80 others.\n\nGhassan Kanafani was an influential author, whose literary works have been translated into as many at least 17 languages and published in 20 countries. He began writing short stories when working as a teacher in refugee camps. Often written through the eyes of children, his stories were designed to help his students contextualize their surroundings.\n\n\"Everything in this world can be robbed and stolen, except one thing; this one thing is the love that emanates from a human being towards a solid commitment to a conviction or cause.\"\n\n- Ghassan Kanafani",

Seeing how people on welfare were treated, she organized those on welfare in the housing project, and in 1963, she founded the ANC, which was one of the first grassroots welfare mothers' organizations in the country.\n\nThis organization later became part of the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO), with Tillmon becoming the first chair of the NWRO. In 1972, she became its executive director when George Wiley resigned. Wiley had been trying to mobilize the working poor, whereas Tillmon tried to align with the feminist movement.\n\nTillmon's 1972 essay, \"Welfare Is a Woman's Issue,\" which was published in the women's magazine \"Ms.\", emphasized women's right to adequate income, regardless of whether they worked in a factory or at home raising children. The National Union of the Homeless used what was called a \"Johnnie Tillmon model\" of organizing, named after her.\n\n\"For a lot of middle-class women in this country, Women's Liberation is a matter of concern. For women on welfare, it's a matter of survival.\" - Johnnie Tillmon",

Zapata was responsible for defeating and ousting various invading armies from Morelos on multiple occasions.\n\nOn April 10th, 1919, Jes\u00fas Guajardo invited Zapata to a meeting, intimating that he intended to defect to the revolutionaries.

On April 11th, a meeting of the United Trades and Labour Council took place where a representative from the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union (ITGWU), Sean Dowling, proposed that the trade unions take over Town Hall and have meetings there.\n\nAfter a twelve-hour discussion and lobbying of the delegates by workers, a general strike was called on April 13th, by the city's United Trades and Labour Council. A special strike committee was set up to print their own money, control food prices, and publish newspapers, and these actions had support from many workers outside the city.\n\nAfter two weeks, the Sinn F\u00e9in Lord Mayor of Limerick and the Catholic Bishop Denis Hallinan called for the strike to end. The Strike Committee capitulated, issuing a proclamation on April 27th, stating that the strike was over.",

The two other rebellions occurred in the Crown colony of Demerara-Essequibo (now part of Guyana) in 1823 and Jamaica in 1831.\n\nThe uprising was led by the African-born slave named Bussa who was born a free West African man, but captured by slave traders and shipped to Barbados. Bussa and his collaborators began to plan the rebellion when the Barbadian House of Assembly was debating a measure to create a registry for all slaves on the island.\n\nThe uprising began on April 14th, 1816 when slaves burned cane fields in the St. Philip parish, a signal to the rest of the island to began the revolt. Over 70 estates were affected, and white people fled en masse to the capitol for shelter.\n\nThe next day, martial law was declared, and the rebellion was quickly put down by local militia and British imperial troops. In total, 214 people were executed, 170 were deported, and many others were subjected to flogging throughout the entire 80 days martial law was in effect.",

This version of the group began to grow more influential, broadening its membership to prominent figures as Benjamin Franklin and Benjamin Rush, who both helped write the Society's new constitution.\n\nIn 1787, the PAS unsuccessfully petitioned the Constitutional Convention to institute a ban on slavery. The following year, they successfully lobbied the Pennsylvania legislature to amend the gradual abolition act of 1780, winning reforms like the banning of transporting slave children and pregnant women out of Pennsyvania and the sending of slave ships from the city. The amended act also imposed heavier fines for slave kidnapping, and made it illegal to separate slave families by more than ten miles.\n\nThe group's influence waned in the decades leading up the Civil War amid economic crises and an increasing anti-black sentiment in the region. Despite their efforts at gradual abolition, slavery was not abolished in the United States until 1865.",

This group would become one the first predominantly black labor unions. Because porters were not unionized, most suffered poor working conditions and were underpaid, despite the industry booming at the time.\n\nAfter years of bitter struggle, the Pullman Company finally began to negotiate with the Brotherhood in 1935, and agreed to a contract with them in 1937.

Although it was the only time the U.S. federal government gave direct aid to slaveowners, many state governments had done so as well.\n\nThe law offered $300 per slave forfeited and $100 to any freed slave, on condition that they move to Haiti or Liberia. Later Lincoln signed a second compensation act into law that allowed former slaves to petition for reimbursement for their own value, but only if their former masters had not already been compensated.\n\nDr. John Rock, a black physician in Boston, said this of the law's passage:\n\n\"Why talk about compensating masters? Compensate them for what? What do you owe them? What does the slave owe them? What does society owe them? Compensate the master? ...It is the slave who ought to be compensated. The property of the South is by right the property of the slave...\"\n\n3,185 slaves were freed as a direct result of the Compensated Emancipation Act, and the anniversary of its passing is still recognized as the holiday \"Emancipation Day\" in Washington D.C.",

Here is a short excerpt from Hall's piece:\n\n\"If there is a war, you will furnish the corpses and the taxes, and others will get the glory. Speculators will make money out of it -- that is, out of you.\n\nMen will get high prices for inferior supplies, leaky boats, for shoddy clothes and pasteboard shoes, and you will have to pay the bill, and the only satisfaction you will get is the privilege of hating your Spanish fellow-workmen, who are really your brothers and who have had as little to do with the wrongs of Cuba as you have.\"",

Eisenhower allocated $13.1 million to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in March 1960 for use against Castro. With the aid of Cuban counter-revolutionaries, the CIA proceeded to organize an invasion.\n\nOn the night of April 17th, an invasion force of approximately 1400 Cuban exiles and CIA officers landed on the beach at Playa Gir\u00f3n in the Bay of Pigs. After a few days, the insurgents became overwhelmed by the Cuban army when Kennedy refused to provide air support for the operation.\n\nThe invasion's defeat solidified Castro's role as a national hero and strengthened Cuba-Soviet relations. Several Cuban exiles and two Americans were executed upon capture. Over 1,000 prisoners were exchanged for humanitarian aid from the U.S. government.",

It is considered part of the \"Coal Wars\", a series of armed conflicts between workers and coal companies from the 1890s - 1930s in the United States.\n\nThe strike lasted for fourteen months, and over 5,000 workers participated. Notable labor organizer Mother Jones (shown above) came to West Virginia to support the workers, organizing a secret march of 3,000 armed miners to the steps of the state capitol in Charleston to read a declaration of war to Governor William E. Glasscock.\n\nThe confrontation directly caused perhaps fifty violent deaths from armed conflicts between miners and strike-breaking forces, as well as many more deaths indirectly caused by starvation and malnutrition among the striking miners. In terms of casualties, it was among the worst conflicts in American labor union history.",

The event took place during the Colorado Coalfield War, a period of violent labor unrest in Colorado from 1913-1914.\n\nThe massacre was the culmination of months of labor strife in Ludlow, Colorado. It began at a meeting between the anti-union militia and a reluctant labor leader Louis Tikas. Although Tikas discouraged violence, the strikers, who had noticed machine guns placed above the Ludlow colony, took cover in ad hoc fire positions.\n\nAccounts differ as to who shot first, but a battle commenced between the armed factions, leading to nearly a dozen deaths, including one twelve-year old boy who was shot in the head. After the violence subdued, Tikas and other strikers were also found shot in the back.\n\nThe chief owner of the mine, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., was widely condemned for having orchestrated the massacre. In retaliation, the miners armed themselves and attacked dozens of anti-union establishments over the next ten days, destroying property and engaging in several skirmishes with the Colorado National Guard in a 40-mile front from Trinidad to Walsenburg.\n\nAn estimated 69 to 199 deaths occurred total during the strike, leading historian Thomas G. Andrews has called it the \"deadliest strike in the history of the United States\".\n\nAlthough the strikers' demands were not met, the event electrified national discussions of labor and had a positive impact on labor rights in the long run.",

The U.S. intervened in the Cuban War of Independence after the internal explosion of the U.S.S. Maine, despite there being no evidence of Spanish involvement in the explosion.\n\nThe outcome of the war resulted in U.S. acquisition of Puerto Rico, Cuba, and the Philippines, and signaled a new era of American expansionism and colonialism in the 20th century.\n\nFrom 1899-1901, the U.S. had to brutally suppress the Filipino movement for independence, killing between 200,000 and 1,000,000 civilians in the Philippine-American War. In 1901, the American government also refused to withdraw troops from Cuba unless their Constitutional Convention signed the Platt Amendment, which gave the U.S. government and capitalists de facto hegemony over the newly \"independent\" Cuba.",

He was also expelled from Kazan Imperial University for participating in protests against the Russian Empire's Tsarist government and was later arrested for sedition and exiled in 1897.\n\nAfter the February Revolution of 1917 ousted the Tsar and established a Provisional Government, he returned to Russia and played a leading role in the October Revolution, in which the Bolsheviks overthrew the new government.\n\nA civil war of remarkable political complexity subsequently broke out, in which the Bolsheviks defeated conservative, social democratic, and anarchist forces to consolidate its own power. Lenin himself served as the head of state for Soviet Russia from 1917 to 1924, and of the Soviet Union from 1922 through 1924.\n\nLenin is known for establishing the political tradition of Marxism-Leninism, which emphasizes the creation of a dictatorship of the proletariat by means of a revolutionary vanguard party and democratic centralism, in which political decisions reached through free discussion are binding upon all members of the political party.\n\nLenin is one of the most influential political thinkers of modern history, authoring influential communist texts such as \"Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism\", \"State and Revolution\", and \"What Is to Be Done? Burning Questions of Our Movement\".\n\n\"Freedom in capitalist society always remains about the same as it was in ancient Greek republics: Freedom for slave owners.\" - Vladimir Lenin",

The conscription measures enjoyed a coalition of opposition - unions, Irish nationalists, and the Catholic Church all supported resisting the measure.\n\nOn April 18th, an Anti-Conscription Committee representing a variety of political factions convened to develop methods for resisting conscription. On the same day, Roman Catholic bishops held a meeting and declared the conscription decree unjust, and called on the Church's adherents to resist \"by the most effective means at our disposal\".\n\nIn the weeks following the April 23rd strike, anti-conscription rallies were held nationwide, with 15,000 people attending a meeting in County Roscommon at the start of May. Despite the conscription law's passage, it was never put in effect - no one in Ireland was drafted into the British Army.",

On April 23rd, the principal was lured off campus, the students convinced the teachers to leave, and, in the school auditorium, the students agreed to stage a walk-out. This act led to a lawsuit which was one of five cases considered in Brown v. Board of Education (1954), which resulted in segregation being declared unconstitutional.\n\nAfter the ruling, rather than desegregate, the Prince Edward County Board of Supervisors refused to appropriate money from the county school board to the public schools. This refusal, which continued for five years, was part of the \"Massive Resistance Movement\", a Virginia state government policy to block the desegregation of public schools. The school - Robert Russa Moton High School - is now a civil rights museum.",

Notable leaders include schoolmaster and Irish language activist Patrick Pearse and socialist James Connolly, who served as head of the ICA.\n\nTogether, this coalition seized strategically important buildings in Dublin. Britain responded militarily, sending thousands of troops and artillery to clash with the Irish revolutionaries.\n\nThe resistance lasted six days before surrendering to the better equipped British Army, and artillery shelling and street fighting left many parts of Dublin in ruin. 3,500 people were captured, 1,800 of them sent to internment camps. 485 people were killed, and more than 2,600 were wounded. Pearse and Connolly, along with 14 others, were executed for their role in the rebellion.\n\nThe Rising was the first armed conflict of a revolutionary period of unrest that began in the early 20th century. In the \"Proclamation of the Irish Republic\", the revolutionaries linked their cause to centuries of struggle:\n\n\"We declare the right of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland and to the unfettered control of Irish destinies, to be sovereign and indefeasible. The long usurpation of that right by a foreign people and government has not extinguished the right, nor can it ever be extinguished except by the destruction of the Irish people.\n\nIn every generation the Irish people have asserted their right to national freedom and sovereignty; six times during the past three hundred years they have asserted it in arms. Standing on that fundamental right and again asserting it in arms in the face of the world, we hereby proclaim the Irish Republic as a Sovereign Independent State, and we pledge our lives and the lives of our comrades in arms to the cause of its freedom, of its welfare, and of its exaltation among the nations.\"",

Although she was initially sentenced to ten years' hard labor for treason, her case was brought back before the Volksgerichtshof in 1944, and she was sentenced to death for \"treasonably rooted herself in the evilest Marxist high-treason propaganda\" and \"treasonably gathering cultural, economic, political, and military intelligence and communicating\" Marxism.\n\nOn the day of her death, she wrote to her children in her diary: \"Keep Goethe's words in mind, 'Die and become'. Don't cry for me. I believe in a better future for you.\"",

On this day in 1952, Flynn issued a statement to the court, demanding a fair trial and condemning the anti-communist hysteria regarding her arrest. Here is an excerpt:\n\n\"We will prove to you that we are not conspirators, but that we are animated and united by common ideals and aspirations, with courage to affirm our beliefs, faith in the people and the future, and a willingness to sacrifice for a better world, which we are confident is in birth...\n\nWe expect to convince you that we are within our established constitutional rights to advocate change and progress, to advocate Socialism, which we are convinced will guarantee to all our people in our great and beautiful country the rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\"\n\nDespite her statement, Flynn was found guilty and served two years in prison.

The name \"Carnation Revolution\" comes from the fact that carnations were placed in the muzzles of guns and on the soldiers' uniforms.\n\nThe revolution toppled the Estado Novo government and ended the unpopular Portuguese Colonial War (leading to independence for Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, Angola, among others), also starting a political process that would result in a more democratic Portugal.\n\nAfter the coup, power was held by the National Salvation Junta (a military junta), and Portugal experienced a period of political turmoil as conflicting communist, socialist, and right-wing forces competed with each other for power.\n\nPortugal's first free election took place on the one-year anniversary of the Carnation Revolution with the purpose of writing a new constitution. Another election was held in 1976 and the first constitutional government, led by center-left socialist M\u00e1rio Soares, took office.",

The delegation were given seats on that flight.\n\nIn January 1967, her health began to decline precipitously around the same time as the splintering of SNCC and she was admitted to a hospital.

A crew-led revolutionary action committee aimed both to free Marty and to take the ship into the port of Odessa, Ukraine.\n\nWhen the ship's captain appealed to the \"national interest\" as a means of quelling the revolt, the soldiers replied \"No and never.

The strike action came after a big economic boom in Denmark that left workers feeling left out from the increased profits of their employers.\n\nThe strike affected a wide variety of industries, from schools to manufacturing to airports to food and petrol stations. Workers in Sweden exhibited solidarity by refusing to load planes heading for Denmark.\n\nMay Day marked the fifth day of the strike, and a gigantic demonstration of more than 500,000 people took place in Copenhagen. The government intervened, ordering everyone back to work on May 11th and announcing that any strikes by the affected workers before March 2000 would be illegal.\n\nA compromise deal was accepted by union leadership, and the majority of strikers returned to work, however some spontaneous walk-outs occurred in the following days - in 96 workplaces, 6,200 workers walked out for a one-day strike. Notably, baggage handlers at Copenhagen International Airport stopped making their contributions to the Social Democratic Party, which led the government throughout the labor action.",

There, she was hunted by the Gestapo as both a Jew and supporter of the French Resistance.  Her son, active in the Resistance, was murdered by French collaborators in 1944, however she survived the war.\n\nFedern was a strong supporter of literacy for women, birth control, and sexual freedom. She wrote: \"Educated mothers relate their own experiences and sufferings to their children; they intuitively understand their feelings and expressions.

On April 25th, 1945, Mussolini attempted to flee Milan for Switzerland after the Comitato di Liberazione Nazionale Alta Italia (Committee of National Liberation for Northern Italy) seized control of the city. Two days later, Mussolini, along with other fascist leaders, were arrested traveling in a German convoy near the village of Dongo.\n\nAccounts vary on how exactly Mussolini was killed, but it is likely that communist partisan Walter Audisio was the person behind the trigger. Regardless, that evening, the bodies of Mussolini, his mistress, and the other executed fascists were loaded onto a van and dumped in Piazzale Loreto, a town square where fifteen partisans had previously been executed by fascists and their bodies left on public display.",

        "description": "On this day in 1965, the United States invaded the Dominican Republic with more than 22,000 troops in order to prevent a \"communist dictatorship\" from forming there.\n\nThe Dominican Republic had been fraught with political instability since the assassination of dictator Rafael Trujillo in 1961. Although Trujillo brutally suppressed the population, his anti-communism made him a natural ally of the U.S. government. After his death, liberal reformer Juan Bosch became president, but was deposed in a coup after less than a year in power.\n\nIn the ensuing power struggle, the U.S. was committed to preventing \"another Cuba\" (i.e., a communist revolution) from taking place. On April 28th, 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson declared that he had taken action to forestall the establishment of a \"communist dictatorship\" in the country, providing reporters with lists of suspected communists there as evidence. These lists, however, contained people who were not communists or were in fact deceased.\n\nThe military action was supported by the Organization of American States (OAS). Over the next few weeks, they established a conservative, non-military government, which held fraudulent elections in June 1966. 69% of American people approved of the decision to send in troops at the time.\n\nAccording to Rory Fanning of Jacobin: \"Upon taking power, U.S.-backed leader Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer began funneling nearly all of Dominican Republic's minerals and sugar into the warehouses of US businesses. His three-decade rule was marked by corruption and fraud. Wages plummeted, unions were dismantled, inflation soared, and unemployment hovered around 30 percent.\"",

The superintendent Albert Burch declared that the company would rather \"shut down and remain closed twenty years\" than to recognize the union. He then fired seventeen workers he believed to be union members and demanded that all other union men collect their back pay and quit.\n\nOn this day in 1899, 250 union members seized a train in Burke, northeast of Wallace, and began making their way to the Bunker Hill mine in Wardner, valued around $250,000. At each stop through Burke Canyon, more miners climbed aboard, eventually numbering over 1,000 strong.\n\nUpon arriving at the mine, the men carried 3,000 pounds (1,400 kg) of dynamite into the mill and detonated it, completely destroying the mill. The group also burned down the company office, the boarding house, and the home of the mine manager. The miners re-boarded the \"Dynamite Express\" and returned the way they came.\n\nState authorities used federal troops to commit mass arrests - over 1,000 men were rounded up and put into a \"bullpen\", including some elected officials and at least one sheriff.

Unhappy with the lack of progress in fighting discrimination by the West Indian Association and inspired by Montgomery Bus Boycott in the United States, the activists decided on a bus boycott in Bristol to win their rights.\n\nThe boycott drew national attention to racial discrimination in Britain and continued for several months. The boycott was finally resolved on August 27th, 1963, when a mass meeting of 500 bus workers agreed to officially put an end to the \"colour bar\". On September 17th, Raghbir Singh, a Sikh, became Bristol's first non-white bus conductor.\n\nThe Bristol Bus Boycott was influential in the passing of the Race Relations Act of 1965 which banned \"racial discrimination in public places\" and the Race Relations Act 1968, which extended those provisions to employment and housing.",

On May 4th, the police attempted to disperse a public gathering in support of the strike and an unidentified person threw a bomb into the police line, killing several officers.\n\nThe police responded by firing on the crowd of protesters. The ensuing violence led to the deaths of seven police officers, four to eight civilians, and wounded approximately one hundred people on either side.\n\nIn a hysterical crackdown, hundreds of labor leaders and sympathizers were detained, many being guilty of nothing more than having political sympathies for labor. Four of them, George Engel, Albert Parsons, August Spies, and Adolph Fischer, were executed by hanging after conviction in a trial widely perceived as a miscarriage of justice. The following day, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, state militia fired on a crowd of strikers killing seven, including a schoolboy and a man feeding chickens in his yard.\n\nMay Day is frequently chosen by labor activists internationally as a day to initiate strikes, boycotts, and other forms of protest.",

The soldiers gave chase and gunfire broke out, killing one officer.\n\nThis led to mobs of white residents, including policemen, firefighters, and city officials, rampaging through black neighborhoods and the houses of freedmen, attacking, raping, and killing black soldiers and civilians.\n\nFamilies were burned alive as their houses were set on fire and the mob prevented them from fleeing. In total, 46 black and 2 white people were killed, 75 persons injured (mostly black), over 100 robbed, and 5 black women testified they were raped.",

Mitchell Palmer.\n\nCPUSA was an early opponent of segregation and racial discrimination, giving legal aid to the Scottsboro Boys and helping poor black farmers in the South organize into sharecropper unions. Because of this, the party had a strong presence in Alabama in the 1930s.\n\nDuring World War II, CPUSA's unwavering support for the Soviet Union alienated other factions of the American left, leading to a decline in membership. CPUSA membership was around 66,000 in 1939, and nearly 20,000 members left the party over the next four years due to the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact between the Soviets and Nazi Germany, which led the party to back off militant anti-fascist rhetoric.",

When six Panthers entered the assembly chamber, where the lawmakers in session, some legislators reportedly took cover under desks. Police then ordered the Panthers to leave the premises, and they peacefully complied while insisting they were within their legal right to carry.\n\nOutside, Bobby Seale spoke to a crowd of reporters. Here is a small excerpt of what he said:\n\n\"Black people have begged, prayed, petitioned, demonstrated, and everything else to get the racist power structure of America to right the wrongs which have historically been perpetuated against black people. All of these efforts have been answered by more repression, deceit and hypocrisy. As the aggression of the racist American government escalates in Vietnam, the police agencies of America escalate the oppression of black people throughout the ghettoes of America.\"\n\nShortly after Seale finished speaking, police arrested the group on felony charges of conspiracy to disrupt a legislative session, although the protesters would later plead down to various misdemeanors instead.",

On May 6th, more than 20,000 students, teachers, and supporters engaged in a protest march. The march was attacked by police and devolved into a riot.\n\nThe state repression of protesters caused two major left union federations, the Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration G\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Travail (CGT) and the Force Ouvri\u00e8re (CGT-FO), to call a one-day general strike on May 13th. More than one million people demonstrated that day.\n\nBy the middle of May, demonstrations had extended to factories, though their demands were different from the students'. Across France, students occupied university structures and up to one-third of the country's workforce was on strike.\n\nThe protests were so widespread and energetic that many political leaders feared civil war or revolution. President Charles de Gaulle secretly fled France to Germany at one point, and the national government at times ceased to function.\n\nRevolution was averted when de Gaulle dissolved the National Assembly and scheduled an election that the left dissidents agreed to participate in. Revolutionary fervor subsided and the government banned a number of leftist organizations in the following months. In the electon, de Gaulle's party won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history, taking 353 of 486 seats versus the Communists' 34 and the Socialists' 57.",

Punishment for the strike fell disproportionately on black workers, with five of the seven fired workers being black despite whites participating in the labor action.\n\nIn response to this and discrimination within the plant - black workers were kept in the lowest-paying and most dangerous jobs, passed over for promotion, and the United Auto Workers union (UAW) would not help them combat discrimination - DRUM was formed to organize the black workers at the company.\n\nIn July, DRUM called for another shutdown of the plant and, this time, more than 3,000 black workers participated in the strike, keeping it closed for over two days. Their success inspired the formation of other Revolutionary Union Movements in other Michigan auto plants and industries, such as FRUM (Ford), CADRUM (GM's Cadillac plant), and GRUM (the larger GM caucus), healthcare workers (HRUM), and UPS workers (UPRUM).\n\nFrom these organizations, seven activists organized the various -RUMs into one umbrella organization with a socialist bent - the League of Revolutionary Black Workers (LRBW). The LRBW sought to transform the UAW from within, eventually compelling the UAW to hire black people into leadership positions.",

It was led by affluent lawyer Thomas Wilson Dorr, who mobilized the disenfranchised to demand changes to the state's electoral rules.\n\nIn 1841, the movement held a \"People's Convention\", where they created their own state constitution, ratifying it and electing Dorr for governor the following year. Although Dorr himself supported giving black men the right to vote, the constitution only enfranchised white men.\n\nOn this day in 1842, members of this movement held an inauguration parade for the Dorr and attempted to create the new government. A \"People's Legislature\" (elected earlier) convened, and Dorr himself led a failed attack on the state arsenal, quickly fleeing the state to avoid arrest.\n\nEventually, Dorr returned to the state and was convicted of treason. Dorrites made a case to the Supreme Court that the \"People's Convention\" constitution was the legitimate one for Rhode Island, but lost the case in \"Luther v. Borden\".

These protests became a national and cultural movement that served as an inspiration for later left-wing movements.\n\nOn the afternoon of May 4th, over 4,000 students of Yenching University, Peking University, and other schools marched from many points to gather in front of Tiananmen. They shouted slogans as \"struggle for the sovereignty externally, get rid of the national traitors at home\", \"do away with the Twenty-One Demands\", and \"don't sign the Versailles Treaty\".\n\nThe next day, students in Beijing as a whole went on strike and in the larger cities across China. Students, merchants, and workers joined the protests. The demonstrators appealed to the newspapers and sent representatives to carry the word across the country. In Shanghai, a general strike of merchants and workers took place, negatively impacting the economy.\n\nIn the years that followed, many Chinese political thinkers turned to leftist politics in the wake of the political upheaval of the May 4th Movement. In 1939, Mao Zedong claimed that the May Fourth Movement was a stage leading toward the fulfillment of his own communist revolution.",

After police began trying to disperse a May 4th rally associated with the strike, an unknown person threw a dynamite bomb at the police. The bomb blast and ensuing gunfire resulted in the deaths of seven police officers, four to eight civilians, and wounded approximately one hundred people on either side.\n\nIn the internationally publicized legal proceedings that followed, eight anarchists were convicted of conspiracy. Seven were sentenced to death and one to a term of 15 years in prison. Illinois Governor Richard J. Oglesby commuted two of the sentences to terms of life in prison; another committed suicide in jail rather than face the gallows. The other four were hanged on November 11th, 1887.\n\nThe trial was widely believed to be a farce and was condemned internationally. The Haymarket Affair, and working class struggle more broadly, is commemorated annually on May 1st as \"May Day\" or \"International Workers' Day\".",

In capitalism, this manifests itself in the conflict between the ruling classes (known as the bourgeoisie) that control the means of production, and the working classes (known as the proletariat) that enable these means by selling their labor power in return for wages.\n\nEmploying a critical approach known as historical materialism, Marx predicted that, like previous socio-economic systems, capitalism produced internal tensions which would lead to its self-destruction and replacement by a new system known as socialism.\n\n\"The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways.

Before the IWW, the only union in place for hotel workers only had about 2,000 members and prohibitively high membership dues.\n\nThe workers demanded at least one day off a week, a higher minimum wage, and a prohibition of discrimination for being in a union. The strike continued through the rest of May but faced repression from the police. The strike officially ended on June 25th, 1912 without legal recognition for the IWW created Hotel Workers' International Union. Despite this failure, hotel workers would go on strike again in 1913, 1918, 1929, and 1934.",

During the striking months, nine people were killed, hundreds were arrested, and the clampdown on shipping cost the waterfront employers an estimated $45 million.\n\nThe ILWU continues to recognize \"Bloody Thursday\" (July 5th, when police officers shot into a crowd of strikers) by shutting down all West Coast ports in honor of all the workers killed by police during the strike.",

He was dissatisfied with the pacifism of the organized abolitionist movement: \"These men are all talk. What we need is action - action!\"\n\nIn October 1859, Brown led a raid on the federal armory at Harpers Ferry, Virginia (today West Virginia), intending to start a slave liberation movement that would spread south through the mountainous regions of Virginia and North Carolina. Although Brown seized the armory, his raid was beaten militarily. Seven people were killed and at least ten were injured.\n\nBrown had intended to arm slaves with weapons from the armory, but only a small number of local slaves were willing to join him, possibly due to an unfamiliarity with firearms. Within 36 hours, those of Brown's men who had not fled were killed or captured by local farmers, militiamen, and U.S. Marines, the latter led by Robert E. Lee.\n\nBrown was hastily tried for treason against the Commonwealth of Virginia, the murder of five men, and inciting a slave insurrection; he was found guilty on all counts and was hanged. Brown was the first person executed for treason in the history of the United States.\n\n\"I, John Brown, am now quite certain that the crimes of this guilty land can never be purged away but with blood. I had, as I now think, vainly flattered myself that without very much bloodshed, it might be done.\" - John Brown",

Following the strike, he was blacklisted and was forced to move away from Cumberland to find work.\n\nIn 1916, he joined the Mining and Smelter workers Union and was elected as Secretary for the Trail chapter. Following his involvement with trade unions, Goodwin entered politics running as a candidate for the Socialist Party of Canada in the 1916 British Columbian election, although he did not win.\n\nAs World War I broke out, Goodwin became an outspoken advocate against the draft, initially refusing to sign up. Eventually, he was compelled to be drafted, and, after exhausting multiple appeals against his conscription, he fled into the hills of Cumberland, British Columbia.\n\nOn July 27th (some sources say July 26th), Goodwin was shot and killed by a member of the Dominion Police, who had ventured into the hills surrounding Comox Lake to locate men evading the draft and arrest them for their evasion. The officer who killed Goodwin successfully claimed self-defense in court, although it is unknown how the two actually encountered each other.\n\nIn protest to his murder, the first general strike in Canada, the Vancouver General Strike, took place on August 2nd, 1918. In 2015, a film about his life titled \"Goodwin's Way\" was released.\n\n\"War is simply part of the process of Capitalism. Big financial interests are playing the game. They'll reap the victory, no matter how the war ends.\"\n\n- Albert Goodwin",

        "description": "On this day in 2000, protesters disrupted the commencement speech of then Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in protest of United States sanctions against Iraq, leading Albright to flee the building after she finished speaking.\n\nIn a recent interview, Albright had stated that the hundreds of thousands of Iraqi children predicted to die from the policy was \"worth it\" to advance U.S. policy in the region.\n\nPalestinian Fadia Rafeedie was initially scheduled to speak before Albright, however Albright's speech was moved first and she immediately left the building following her speech.\n\nWhen it was Rafeedie's time to speak, she put aside her prepared remarks and spoke out against U.S. policy towards Iraq and the devastation it was causing on the population there. She ended her speech by saying this:\n\n\"I want to end my speech with a slogan that hangs over my bed in Arabic. It says, 'La tastaw Hishu tareeq el-Haq, min qilit es-sa'ireen fihi' and that translates into, 'Fear not the path of truth for the lack of people walking on it.' I think our future is going to be the future of truth, and we're going to walk on that path, and we're going to fill it with travelers. Thank you very much.\"",

After a federal injunction to stop the strike was ignored, 12,000 troops were sent in to forcibly break the strike. All in all, 30 strikers were killed, 57 were wounded, and property damage exceeded $80 million.\n\nThe Pullman Strike was a watershed moment in American labor history - Eugene V. Debs, who led the strike, was arrested and imprisoned, radicalizing his politics and setting him on the path to become a prominent socialist leader and co-founder of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW).\n\nAfter the strike was over, President Cleveland declared the national holiday \"Labor Day\" in an effort to appease organized labor.",

Tensions increased when a false rumor spread that Charles Evers, older brother of Medgar Evers and a civil rights activist in his own right, had been killed.\n\nThe police responded in force; at least 75 Jackson police units from the city of Jackson and the Mississippi Highway Patrol attempted to control the crowd, while firemen extinguished fires that had been set. After the firefighters had left the scene, the police moved to disperse the crowd that had gathered in front of Alexander Hall, a women's dormitory.\n\nJust after midnight, the police opened fire on the building. The gunfire lasted for 30 seconds and more than 460 shots were fired. Every window on the narrow side of the building facing Lynch Street was shattered and two people were killed, one a seventeen year old at a nearby high school. Twelve more were wounded.",

        "description": "On this day in 1950, a general strike in Nairobi, Kenya began after two trade union leaders were arrested, paralyzing airport travel and public services, and leading to the state arresting labor organizers en masse.\n\nThe Nairobi General Strike was the culmination of Kenya's post war strike wave and urban upheaval, also coming on the heels of a general strike in Mombasa in 1947, led by the African Workers Federation (AWF).\n\nIn the decade leading up to the strike, Nairobi's population more than doubled to at least 100,000, mostly attributable to wartime migration into the city. This was fueled by serious problems of landlessness in the Kikuyu reserves, which were pushing out increasing numbers of ahoi. The land litigation cases that followed, especially in Kiambu, saw the losers becoming either workers in their former lands, now owned by the growing elite of commercial farmers, or simply leaving for Nairobi.\n\nOn the morning of May 15th, Fred Kubai and Makhan Singh, leaders in the East African Trades Union Congress (EATCU), were arrested by and charged with being officers of an unregistered trade union refusing to dissolve within the three month notification period.\n\nLater the same day, members of the EATCU declared a general strike to begin on the 16th, but by evening a general strike was already in effect all over Nairobi.\n\nThe strike paralyzed airport travel, public services, and greatly limited commercial business. Strike leadership called off the action after a week's worth of protest, disseminating a return-to-work order for May 25th.\n\nIn the aftermath of the strike, the power of trade unions was diminished with the government arresting thousands of their members. Despite this setback, the labor movement in Kenya was not broken and continued to gain momentum in the following decade.",

On May 18th, two hundred students gathered at the gate of Chonnam National University in defiance of its closing, clashing with thirty paratroopers.\n\nThe protest was violently subdued, and the first fatality of the repression was a 29-year old deaf man who had simply been passing by. In response, the population rebelled en masse, with more than 10,000 protesters joining the students over the next few days.\n\nAs the protests grew, so did state repression and an increasingly militant civilian response to it. By May 21st, civilian militias were engaging in full-blown battles with the army. After the civilian militias acquired and began using light machine guns, the army retreated and protesters temporarily gained control of Gwangju.\n\nThe rebellion was sustained until being defeated by force on May 27th. There is no official death toll for the uprising; figures vary from the low hundreds to more than two thousand dead. Regardless, the recorded deaths in the month of May were 2,300 higher than average. Nearly 1,400 were arrested for involvement in the Gwangju incident, and 427 were indicted.\n\nIn May 2020, 40 years after the uprising, the independent \"May 18 Democratization Movement Truth Commission\" was launched to investigate the crackdown and use of military force. Under legislation passed in 2018, it would operate for two years, with a one-year extension allowed if necessary.",

When the agents attempted to leave town that evening, they were stopped by Matewan Police Chief Sid Hatfield, who claimed to have arrest warrants from the county sheriff.\n\nThe agents then produced their own warrant for Sid Hatfield's arrest, however the Matewan Mayor Cabell Testerman declared it fake upon inspection. While this discussion was happening, the group was quietly surrounded by armed miners, who were watching while hidden in buildings along the street.\n\nGunfire broke out (it is unknown which group fired first), and ten people were killed in the subsequent fighting. Seven of the agents and the Mayor Cabell were killed. Hatfield, however, survived and was immediately regarded as a hero by the coal miners.\n\nHatfield was later assassinated while standing trial for murder by other Baldwin-Felts agents, who successfully claimed self-defense, despite the fact he was unarmed while gunned down on the courthouse steps.\n\nThe incident inflamed tensions between either side. Six months after Hatfield's assassination, the Battle of Blair Mountain took place when more than 10,000 miners took up arms against the state.",

Malcolm quickly became a leader with the NOI and was paroled in 1952, beginning a period of radical advocacy for black liberation.\n\nHis policy of allowing for violent self-defense (i.e., achieving freedom \"by any means necessary\") and opposition to integration stood in stark contrast to his contemporary Martin Luther King Jr., whom Malcolm once referred to as a \"chump\".\n\nIn the 1960s, Malcom X broke with the Nation of Islam, growing disillusioned with its leader Elijah Muhammed. During his 1964 pilgrimage to Mecca, he witnessed Muslims of \"all colors, from blue-eyed blonds to black-skinned Africans\" treat each other as equals in worship. Because of this, Malcolm X became convinced that Islam could be used as a means to achieve racial equality, a position he was previously skeptical of.\n\nOn February 21, 1965, he was assassinated in New York City. Three Nation members were charged with the murder and given indeterminate life sentences.\n\n\"Nobody can give you freedom. Nobody can give you equality or justice or anything.

Haiti was the first country in the region to outlaw slavery.\n\nLouverture's participation in the war was complex, first fighting for the Spanish against the French; then for France against Spain and Great Britain; and finally, he fought on behalf of independence for Saint-Domingue against the French.\n\nInitially, Louverture was only supportive of fighting for better living conditions for slaves, but, after committing to the full abolition of slavery in 1791, he issued a proclamation at Camp Turel of St. Domingue: \"Brothers and friends, I am Toussaint Louverture; perhaps my name has made itself known to you. I have undertaken vengeance. I want Liberty and Equality to reign in St Domingue. I am working to make that happen. Unite yourselves to us, brothers and fight with us for the same cause.\"\n\nAs a revolutionary leader, Louverture's military and political acumen helped transform the fledgling slave rebellion into a revolutionary movement. He governed Saint-Domingue with varying degrees of power for several years, proclaiming an autonomous constitution for the colony in 1801 that declared himself its governor for life.\n\nLouverture was eventually tricked into being arrested by Brunet, a French General, and deported to France, where he died of unknown causes while imprisoned. Shortly thereafter, the colony finally achieved independence under the leadership of Jean-Jacques Dessalines.\n\n\"This gun is liberty; hold for certain that the day when you no more have it, you will be returned to slavery.\" - Toussaint Louverture",

CPUSA's membership declined by 15% in the following year.\n\nBrowder was an advocate for a cooperative relationship between the Soviet Union and the United States after World War II, and was sharply criticized by the French Communist Party (later revealed to have been done so on orders from Moscow) in the \"Duclos Letter\".\n\nDue to the domestic Red Scare in the U.S. and Browder's ambitions clashing with the Soviet agenda, Browder was expelled from the Communist Party on February 5th, 1946.",

The government of the Paris Commune developed a set of progressive, secular, and social democratic policies, although its existence was too brief to implement all of them.\n\nAmong these policies were the separation of church and state, abolition of child labor, abolishment of interest on some forms of debt, as well as the right of employees to take over and run an enterprise if it was deserted by its original owner.\n\nThe commune was attacked by the French National Army on May 21st, 1871, beginning the so-called \"Bloody Week\", which defeated the revolutionary movement. After crushing the rebellion, the French government imprisoned approximately 44,000 people for their role in the uprising. Estimated deaths from the fighting are around 20,000.\n\nThe Paris Commune was analyzed by many communist thinkers, most notably Karl Marx, who called it a \"dictatorship of the proletariat.\" Vladimir Lenin danced in the snow when the newly formed Bolshevik government lasted longer than the Paris Commune.\n\nThe episode inspired similar revolutionary attempts around the world, including in Moscow (1905), Petrograd (1917), Shanghai (1927 and 1967), and Seattle (2020).",

On January 5th, 1970, Oakes' 12-year-old daughter, Yvonne, fell to her death from concrete steps. After her funeral, Oakes left the island.\n\nIn 1972, Oakes was shot and killed in Sonoma, California, by Michael Morgan, a YMCA camp manager. Allegedly, Oakes violently confronted Morgan, and Morgan responded by drawing a handgun and fatally shooting Oakes.\n\nOakes was unarmed when he was shot. Morgan claimed he acted in self-defense, and was acquitted on charges of voluntary manslaughter.\n\n\"We do not fear your threat to charge us with crimes on our land. We and all other oppressed peoples would welcome spectacle of proof before the world of your title by genocide. Nevertheless, we seek peace.\" - Richard Oakes",

He was imprisoned in Sicily for opposing Italy's entry into World War I (and was interned in Sicily during the conflict for this reason).\n\nMatteotti spoke openly against Italian Fascism and Benito Mussolini, and for a time was leader of the opposition to the National Fascist Party (NFP). In 1921, he denounced fascist violence in a pamphlet titled \"Inchiesta socialista sulle gesta dei fascisti in Italia\" (\"Socialist enquiry on the deeds of the fascists in Italy\").\n\nOn May 30th, 1924, speaking in the Italian Parliament, he alleged that the Fascists committed fraud in the recently held elections and denounced the violence that they used to gain votes. Eleven days later, he was kidnapped and killed by Fascists.\n\nAfter Matteotti's body was discovered, Mussolini took full responsibility for the murder as head of the Fascist party (although whether he gave a direct order for the murder remains uncertain) and dared his critics to prosecute him for the crime.\n\nThis challenge went unaccepted. After the Second World War ended, Italian fascists Amerigo Dumini, Giuseppe Viola, and Amleto Poveromo were sentenced to thirty years in prison for their involvement in Matteotti's murder.\n\n\"Now start composing your oration for my funeral.\" - Giacomo Matteotti, to his friend after denouncing Mussolini in 1924, eleven days before his death",

The strike took place in the context of federal repression of labor movements; a few years earlier, Canada had banned the similar Industrial Workers of the World (IWW).\n\nAccordingly, the striking workers faced violent repression from both the government and the coal operators. After the walk-out continued more than a month, coal operators received permission from the Northwest Mounted Police to hire \"special constables\" - in practice unemployed World War I veterans who were paid $10 a day, plied with free liquor, and armed with brass knuckles and crowbars - to break up the strike.\n\nStriking workers were attacked in their homes, and workers who refused to act as scabs were driven 65-km out of town, beaten, and left there. Strikers responded by forming self-defense militias that deterred constables form attacking them. The labor action was finally broken after the federal government declared the OBU illegal and two strike leaders were beaten, tied to telephone poles, and tarred and feathered in August of that year.\n\nDespite the immediate defeat, the mere threat of militant industrial action allowed coal miners in Alberta to achieve massive gains: the miners' day rate rose from $5.70 to $7.50 between 1919 and 1920 and, even after the strike had collapsed, and the rate remained well above inflation for a few years. These gains were eroded by 1924-25, when salaries were reduced back to the pre-strike levels.",

The bombing took place in the context of the Redwood Summer protests organized by Earth First!, the culmination of years of labor organizing and environmental activism in California by Bari.\n\nFBI bomb investigators were present on the scene of the bombing almost immediately, leading some to speculate that the FBI either knew of the bombing or was directly involved in it. Bari was arrested for transporting explosives while she was still in critical condition with a fractured pelvis and other major injuries. In 2002, a federal jury found the FBI had violated Bari and Cherney's civil rights in the case, and the pair was later awarded a $4.4 million payout, although Bari had died five years earlier.\n\nFBI analysis of the explosion dismissed the idea that the bomb was designed by Bari or Cherney. The identity of the bomber is still unknown. As for the protests, subsequent attendance was lower than organizers had hoped, and in November the pro-environment ballot initiative Proposition 130 was defeated by California voters.",

He is also known by the name Yo Un-hyung or the pen-name \"Mongyang\".\n\nLyuh was born in Yangpyeong, Gyeonggi Province, the son of a local yangban magnate.  In 1910, Lyuh parted from Korean tradition by freeing his household's slaves, giving them enough land and money to become self-sufficient.\n\nLike many in the Korean independence movement, Lyuh sought aid from both right and left. In 1920, he joined the Kory\u01d2 Communist Party, later meeting Leon Trotsky and Vladimir Lenin. In 1924, he also joined Sun Yat-sen's Chinese Nationalist Party to facilitate Sino-Korean cooperation.\n\nIn September 1945, Lyuh proclaimed the establishment of the People's Republic of Korea and became its vice-premier. When the United States occupied the Korean Peninsula, it did not recognize the People's Republic of Korea, and in October he was forced to step down under pressure from the U.S. military government.\n\nIn 1946, Lyuh represented the center-left politically as part of an effort to unify right and left-wing independence struggles, however this strategy earned ire from both sides. On July 19th, 1947, Lyuh was assassinated in Seoul by a 19-year-old North Korean refugee who was an active member of a nationalist right-wing organization.\n\nHis pen-name was Mongyang, the Hanja for \"dream\" and \"the sun\".

All participants in the conflict were guilty of murdering Jews, even the Bolsheviks; however the Volunteer Army had the largest number of victims.\"\n\nThe number of Jews killed during the period is estimated to be between 35,000 and 50,000. A total of 1,236 violent attacks on Jews had been recorded between 1918 and 1921 in Ukraine.\n\nThe role of Petliura in those pogroms is controversial. While Petliura actively sought to halt anti-Jewish violence on numerous occasions, including the punishment capital punishment for the crime of pogroming, it is also documented that he was afraid to punish officers and soldiers engaged in crimes against Jews for fear of losing their support.\n\nSchwarzbard was a Jewish anarchist living in Paris, becoming acquainted with other anarchist activists who had emigrated from Russia and Ukraine, including figures such as Volin, Alexander Berkman, Emma Goldman, and Nestor Makhno.\n\nAt the same time, Petliura was living in Paris in exile. On May 25th, 1926, Schwarzbard approached Petliura and asked him in Ukrainian, \"Are you Mr. Petliura?\" Petliura did not answer but raised his cane in response.\n\nSchwartzbard pulled out a gun, shooting him seven times. At the trial, survivors of the pogroms testified that they were brutalized by soldiers who claimed to be acting on orders from Petliura. After eight days, Schwarzbard was acquitted.",

When asked \"Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?\", Mandel responded:\n\n\"Honorable beaters of children, sadists, uniformed and in plain clothes, distinguished Dixiecrat wearing the clothing of a gentleman, eminent Republican who opposes an accommodation with the one country with which we must live at peace in order for us and all our children to survive.\n\n...\n\nIf you think that I am going to cooperate with this collection of Judases, of men who sit there in violation of the United States Constitution, if you think I will cooperate with you in any way, you are insane!\"",

In June, the protests became national in scope and transcended any particular demographic or political ideology. Among the wide range of concerns brought by protesters were issues of freedom of the press, expression, and assembly, as well as the alleged political Islamist government's erosion of Turkey's secularism.\n\nMillions of Turkish football fans, normally divided by intense sports rivalry, marched in unity against the government. Protesters displayed symbols the environmentalist movement, rainbow banners, depictions of Che Guevara, different trade unions, and the PKK and its leader Abdullah \u00d6calan.\n\nOn June 4th, Taksim Dayan\u0131\u015fmas\u0131 (Taksim Solidarity) issued a set of demands that included the preservation of Gezi Park, an end to police violence, the right to freedom of assembly, and an end to the privatization of public spaces. Deputy Prime Minister B\u00fclent Ar\u0131n\u00e7 met the group on June 5th and rejected these demands.\n\nErdo\u011fan blamed the protests on \"internal traitors and external collaborators\", demonizing his political opposition as the former.

The federal government obtained an injunction against the union, Eugene V. Debs, and other boycott leaders, ordering them to stop interfering with trains that carried mail cars. After the strikers refused, President Grover Cleveland forcibly ended the strike with military force.\n\nDebs and four other ARU leaders were arrested and charged with violating the injunction. After the Supreme Court sided with the government, Debs was sentenced to prison and the ARU dissolved.\n\nIn re Debs contributed to a widely held belief that the Supreme Court was simply a tool of the wealthy and big business - for the next 40 years business interests hostile to labor unions found the courts willing partners in suppressing strikes through injunction.

While there, Bishop acquired a law degree and studied the works of Lenin, Mao Zedong, and Julius Nyerere.\n\nIn 1970, he returned to Grenada and was active politically, representing striking nurses in court and leading the New Jewel Movement (NJM), a Marxist-Leninist vanguard party. In 1979, the NJM successfully led a coup against Eric Gairy and made Bishop the Prime Minister of Grenada.\n\nAmong Bishop's core principles were workers' rights, women's rights, and the struggle against racism and apartheid. Women were given equal pay and paid maternity leave. Sex discrimination was made illegal. Organizations for education, health care, youth affairs, and literacy were also established. Due to his government's efforts, illiteracy and unemployment greatly declined.\n\nIn 1983, disputes within the party culminated in Bishop, along with seven members of his cabinet, being captured and executed. After his assassination, the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) and Grenada's governor-general Paul Scoon appealed to the United States to resolve the political situation.

Truth was born into slavery in Swartekill, New York, but escaped with her infant daughter to freedom in 1826. After going to court to recover her son in 1828, she became the first black woman to win such a case against a white man.\n\nOn this day in 1851, Sojourner Truth gave what is now known as the \"Ain't I a Woman\" speech, delivered to the Women's Convention in Akron, Ohio. Here is a short excerpt (from Marius Robinson's transcription):\n\n\"I want to say a few words about this matter. I am a woman's rights. [sic] I have as much muscle as any man, and can do as much work as any man. I have plowed and reaped and husked and chopped and mowed, and can any man do more than that? I have heard much about the sexes being equal. I can carry as much as any man, and can eat as much too, if I can get it. I am as strong as any man that is now.\n\nAs for intellect, all I can say is, if a woman have a pint, and a man a quart - why can't she have her little pint full? You need not be afraid to give us our rights for fear we will take too much, - for we can't take more than our pint'll hold.\"",

He was met with violent resistance, which rapidly spread across the southeast of the country.\n\nInspired by the sermons of the radical cleric John Ball, an army of rebels led by Wat Tyler marched on London. There, they were joined by many locals, and together they attacked gaols, executed government officials, and destroyed government property.\n\nOn June 14th, King Richard II met with the rebels, submitting to most of their demands, including the abolition of serfdom. The following day, however, he took back these concessions and killed Wat Tyler.\n\nUnrest continued for weeks afterward, but the rebels were crushed by state forces. Most of the rebel leaders were tracked down and executed. By November, at least 1,500 rebels had been killed. The revolt heavily influenced the course of the Hundred Years' War, by deterring later Parliaments from raising additional taxes to pay for military campaigns in France.",

Bakunin's prestige as an activist also made him one of the most famous ideologues in Europe, gaining substantial influence among radicals throughout Russia and Europe.\n\nBakunin is also notable as a vehement opponent of Marxism, especially of the dictatorship of the proletariat, predicting that Marxist governments would become one-party dictatorships over the proletariat, not by the proletariat. On this matter, he stated \"Either one destroys the State or one must accept the vilest and most fearful lie of our century: the red bureaucracy.\"\n\nBakunin also espoused anti-Semitic views in some of his works, writing \"...and where there is centralization of the state, there must necessarily be a central bank, and where such a bank exists, the parasitic Jewish nation, speculating with the labor of the people, will be found.\" Anarchist thinkers today, however, do not generally consider these views central to his political thought.\n\nHis biographer Mark Leier wrote that \"Bakunin had a significant influence on later thinkers, ranging from Peter Kropotkin and Errico Malatesta to the Wobblies and Spanish anarchists in the Civil War to Herbert Marcuse, E.P. Thompson, Neil Postman, and A.S. Neill, down to the anarchists gathered these days under the banner of 'anti-globalization.'\"\n\n\"Freedom without socialism is privilege and justice, and socialism without freedom is slavery and brutality.\" - Mikhail Bakunin",

Zion Methodist Church, which had been a site for a CORE Freedom School.\n\nArrested by the local sheriff, the trio was released that evening without being allowed to contact anyone. On the road, they were stopped by patrol lights and two carloads of KKK members, kidnapped, tortured, and killed.\n\nThe sheriff, along with six others, were indicted and convicted for depriving the three men of their civil rights. No one was held accountable for Chaney's murder until 2005, when outspoken white supremacist Edgar Ray Killen was convicted on three counts of manslaughter.",

Historians disagree as to whether such a plot existed and, if there was one, its scale.\n\nDespite the lack of hard evidence for such a conspiracy, many in New York City were hysterical with paranoia over poor whites and slaves collaborating to burn the city down. During a series of court cases brought against alleged members of this conspiracy, the prosecution repeatedly changed the grounds of accusation and ignored the alibis proffered by slaveowners for their slaves' non-involvement.\n\nAt its height, over half of the city's male slaves over the age of 16 were implicated in the plot and jailed. On this day in 1741, the first two victims, two slaves named Kofi and Quaco, were hanged.\n\nAfter the hysteria ended, eighteen slaves were hanged, thirteen burned alive, four whites were executed, and dozens of people had been deported out of the city.",

Shots rang out when a white person tried to disarm one of the black men. The initial violence left ten people dead, and a mob of enraged white people stormed black neighborhoods, indiscriminately killing people and destroying property.\n\nFor 75 years (until 1996), the massacre was almost totally omitted from local, state, and national histories.

        "description": "Cornel West, born on this day in 1953, is a philosopher, socialist activist, educator, and public intellectual whose works include \"Race Matters\" and \"The Rich and the Rest of Us: A Poverty Manifesto\", co-authored with Tavis Smiley.\n\nThe son of a Baptist minister, West's political thought focuses on the role of race, gender, and class in American society. A radical democrat and advocate for social democracy, West draws intellectual contributions from multiple traditions, including the black Christian church, Marxism (although he identifies as a non-Marxist socialist, believing the Christian faith and Marxism to be irreconcilable), and transcendentalism.\n\nAmong his works are \"Race Matters\" (1994), \"Democracy Matters\" (2004), and \"The Rich and the Rest of Us: A Poverty Manifesto\" (2012), co-authored with Tavis Smiley. In this last work, Smiley and West provide a broad, multi-racial look at the history and experience of poverty in the United States, concluding with a twelve-point program to address this poverty.\n\nWest has served as honorary chair of the Democratic Socialists of America, which he has described as \"the first multiracial, socialist organization close enough to my politics that I could join\". He also described himself as a \"radical democrat, suspicious of all forms of authority\" in the Matrix-themed documentary \"The Burly Man Chronicles\".\n\nWest was arrested on October 13th, 2014, while protesting against the shooting of Michael Brown and participating in \"Ferguson October\", and again on August 10th, 2015, while demonstrating outside a courthouse in St. Louis on the one-year anniversary of Brown's death.\n\n\"To be an intellectual really means to speak a truth that allows suffering to speak. That is, it creates a vision of the world that puts into the limelight the social misery that is usually hidden or concealed by the dominant viewpoints of a society. 'Intellectual' in that sense simply means those who are willing to reflect critically upon themselves as well as upon the larger society and to ascertain whether there is some possibility of amelioration and betterment.\" - Cornel West",

The internet in Sudan was blacked out for days following the massacre.\n\nThe sit-in took place in the context of the Sudanese revolution, beginning with mass anti-government protests in December 2018. On April 11th, the military removed President Omar al-Bashir from power in a coup d'\u00e9tat, creating a Transitional Military Council (TMC). Protesters supported by the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA) and various democratic opposition groups engaged in street demonstrations, demanding the TMC turn over power to a civilian-led transitional government.\n\nIn the days following the massacre, anti-TMC protests became even more intense, and a general strike involving 60-100% of workers broke out across the country. Roads were blocked and almost all formal and informal businesses were closed, including banks, public transport and Khartoum International Airport.",

        "description": "On this day in 1943, the Zoot Suit Riots began when thousands of white American servicemen in California began indiscriminately attacking people (mostly Latinos) wearing Zoot Suits, which were seen as unpatriotic. The suits were ostensibly seen as unpatriotic due to wartime rations, although they were also racialized, with L.A. Councilman Norris Nelson stating \"the zoot suit has become a badge of hoodlumism\".\n\nThe riots began on the night of June 3rd when ~12 sailors and a group of young Mexicans in zoot suits began fighting. The LAPD responded to the incident \"seeking to clean up Main Street from what they viewed as the loathsome influence of pachuco gangs\", according to historian Luis Alvarez. The police arrested the sailors and not the Mexicans.\n\nThe next day, 200 sailors headed for East Los Angeles, a Mexican-American part of town, and attacked and stripped everyone they came across who were wearing zoot suits. Local press heralded the violence as cleaning up the town, and soon thousands of sailors joined the riot. Journalist Carey McWilliams described what happened like this:\n\n\"Marching through the streets of downtown Los Angeles, a mob of several thousand soldiers, sailors, and civilians, proceeded to beat up every zoot suiter they could find. Pushing its way into the important motion picture theaters, the mob ordered the management to turn on the house lights and then ran up and down the aisles dragging Mexicans out of their seats. Streetcars were halted while Mexicans, and some Filipinos and Negroes, were jerked from their seats, pushed into the streets and beaten with a sadistic frenzy.\"\n\nThe L.A. City Council approved a resolution criminalizing zoot suits, although the ordinance was not signed into law. The Navy and Marine Corps Staff prohibited sailors from traveling to L.A. in an effort to curb the violence, however they officially maintained that the men were acting in self-defense.",

After the murder of Chaggar, John Kingsley Read, a former chairman of the NF, stated \"one down, a million to go\".

        "description": "On this day in 1835, the first recorded general strike in North America broke out in Philadelphia when striking Irish dock workers were joined by workers of all kinds from the city, winning their demands on June 22nd.\n\nThe strike involved around 20,000 workers who were demanding a ten-hour workday and increased wages. The strike ended in complete victory for the workers and, as the news of their success spread, paved the way for a ten-hour day in the American and European labor movements more broadly.\n\nInfluenced by labor agitation in Boston, the strike began with unskilled Irish workers on the Schuylkill River coal wharves going out on strike for a ten-hour day. The dock workers patrolled the picket line with swords, threatening any scab who attempted to unload coal from the 75 vessels waiting in the water.\n\nThe coal heavers were soon joined by workers from many other trades, including leather dressers, printers, carpenters, bricklayers, masons, house painters, bakers, and city employees.\n\nOn June 6th, a mass meeting of workers, lawyers, doctors, and a few businessmen, was held in the State House courtyard. The meeting unanimously adopted a set of resolutions giving full support to the workers' demand for wage increases and a shorter workday, as well as increased wages for women workers and a boycott of any coal merchant who worked his men more than ten hours.\n\nThe strike quickly came to a close after city public works employees joined the labor action. The Philadelphia city government announced that the \"hours of labor of the working men employed under the authority of the city corporation would be from 'six to six' during the summers season, allowing one hour for breakfast, and one for dinner.\"\n\nOn June 22nd, three weeks after the coal heavers initially struck, the ten-hour system and an increase in wages for piece-workers was adopted in the city. A wave of successful strikes across the United States followed this victory. By the end of 1835, the ten-hour day had become the standard for most day city laborers.",

Some courts called them \"conspiracies to restrain trade\", and were therefore illegal.\n\nIn 1836, twenty-five members of the Union Society of Journeymen Tailors were found guilty of \"conspiracy to injure trade, riot, assault, and battery\" in the state of New York. On June 6th, 27,000 people gathered in City Hall Park to protest the court decision.\n\nA radical pamphlet circulated, titled \"The Rich Against the Poor\", that denounced the judge who issued the decision as a \"tool of aristocracy\". The protesters established a \"Committee of Correspondence\" that comprised of people working in trades, which went on to found the working class Equal Rights party.",

Even teenage boys sweeping the floors were paid more than the women working there.\n\nIn response to this, all 187 women went on strike on June 7th, demanding equal pay for equal work. Despite their labor being classified as unskilled, car production halted within a week. The factory was forced to come to a complete standstill, eventually costing the company over $8 million. Despite this, Ford refused to negotiate.\n\nThe strike ended after Barbara Castle, the Secretary of State for Employment and Productivity, intervened, beginning a set of negotiations at which men were not allowed. The strike ended with an immediate increase of their rate of pay to 8% below that of men, rising to the full Category B rate the following year. In 1984, following an additional strike, the women were categorized as Category C.\n\nThe labor action is considered key to the passing of the Equal Pay Act 1970 prohibited inequality of treatment between men and women in Britain in terms of pay and conditions of employment.

The workers responded by chasing away the strike-breakers in the days before the battle. The strikers returned on June 8th with police protection that was quickly overwhelmed by striking workers. In response to the violence, the government deployed troops and ships from to the area.\n\nAfterward, 28 strikers were arrested and put on trial, 20 of whom were sentenced to prison. Most of those arrested were members of the Norwegian Communist Party and the Norwegian Labour Party. Worker organization did not prevent mass unemployment during the Great Depression; in the winter of 1932\u20131933, up to 40% of the trade unionists were unemployed.",

Coal miners were able to survive on relief payments and donations from supporters as far away as Boston and Winnipeg. After three months of a work stoppage, the corporation planned to resume operations without any settlement with workers.\n\nTo maintain the shutdown, coal miners seized and shut down the power plant that served both the company's mines and the city of New Waterford in early June. The shortage of water and power affected New Waterford citizens, but the miners drew on local wells and set up a volunteer service to deliver water to the hospital.\n\nOn June 11th, a force of company police recaptured the power plant. Hundreds of coal miners, possibly more than 2,000 in number, marched to Waterford Lake in protest. It was there that the company police fired on the crowd, killing thirty-eight-year-old William Davis.\n\nThis annual commemoration to all miners killed in labor struggle and industrial accidents became official in Nova Scotia in 2008, officially recognized as William Davis Miners' Memorial Day.",

His murder and the resulting trials inspired a wave of civil rights protests; his life inspired numerous works of art, music, and film.\n\nAll-white juries failed to reach verdicts in the first two trials of Beckwith in the 1960s.

Among these provisions were the government of Cuba consenting to the right of the United States to \"intervene for the preservation of Cuban independence, the maintenance of a government adequate for the protection of life, property, and individual liberty\".\n\nFollowing acceptance of the amendment, the United States ratified a tariff that gave Cuban sugar preference in the U.S. market and protection to select U.S. products in the Cuban market. Over $200 million was spent by American companies on Cuban sugar between 1903 and 1913, and this investment into sugar led to land being concentrated into the hands of the largest sugar mills, with estimates that 20% of all Cuban land was owned by these mills.",

These charges were later dismissed after prosecutors investigating the Watergate scandal discovered that the staff members in the Nixon White House had ordered the so-called \"White House Plumbers\" to engage in unlawful efforts to discredit Ellsberg.\n\nOn January 3rd, 1973, Ellsberg was charged under the Espionage Act of 1917 along with other charges of theft and conspiracy, carrying a total maximum sentence of 115 years.

Referring to Che's restless nature, his father noted \"the first thing to note is that in my son's veins flowed the blood of the Irish rebels\".\n\nIn 1950 and 1951, he embarked on two continent-wide motorcycle journeys throughout South and Central America, observing poverty and poor working conditions that left a deep impression on his worldview. He later published a memoir of these experiences called \"The Motorcycle Diaries\", dubbed by Verso Books as \"Das Kapital meets Easy Rider\".\n\nIn 1956, Che Guevara sailed to Cuba to aid in the struggle against Batista, narrowly surviving an attack by Batista's forces after they landed on the island. He became a major figure of the Cuban Revolution, promoted by Fidel Castro to Comandante of a second army column.\n\nFollowing the Cuban Revolution's success, Guevara performed a number of key roles in the new government. These included reviewing the appeals and firing squads for those convicted as war criminals during the revolutionary tribunals, instituting agrarian land reform, helping spearhead a successful nationwide literacy campaign, serving as both national bank president and instructional director for Cuba's armed forces, and traversing the globe as a diplomat on behalf of Cuban socialism.\n\nGuevara left Cuba in 1965 to foment revolution abroad, first unsuccessfully in Congo-Kinshasa and later in Bolivia, where he was captured by CIA-assisted Bolivian forces and summarily executed.\n\n\"At the risk of seeming ridiculous, let me say that the true revolutionary is guided by a great feeling of love. It is impossible to think of a genuine revolutionary lacking this quality.\" - Che Guevara",

It was during this period, in the decade before the Civil War, that she authored \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\". Within a year of its publication, the book sold an unprecedented 300,000 copies and was widely read in both the United States and Great Britain.\n\nHarriet Stowe was also an early feminist thinker, connecting the struggle for black liberation to the struggle for women's liberation more broadly, writing in 1869 that \"the position of a married woman...is, in many respects, precisely similar to that of the negro slave. She can make no contract and hold no property; whatever she inherits or earns becomes at that moment the property of her husband...Though he acquired a fortune through her, or though she earned a fortune through her talents, he is the sole master of it, and she cannot draw a penny\".",

Justice for Janitors includes more than 225,000 janitors in at least 29 cities in the United States and at least four cities in Canada. Members fight for better wages, better conditions, improved health-care, and full-time opportunities.\n\nOn this day in 1990, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) attacked immigrant janitors who were striking for the right to organize in Century City, making two women miscarry, hospitalizing dozens, and jailing sixty more. Police initially claimed to be defending themselves, however TV footage was aired that undermined this claim.\n\nDespite the violence, workers voted unanimously to return to the scene of the attack and continue their protest. Janitors eventually won the right to form a union, doubling their pay and benefits. This victory gave significant momentum to the JfJ movement and led to successful protests by and organizing of janitors around the country.",

An excerpt reads:\n\n\"We need to wake up and realize that our real enemies are not in some distant land...The enemy is a system that wages war when it's profitable. The enemy is CEOs who lay us off our jobs when it's profitable. It's the insurance companies who deny us health care when it's profitable. It's the banks who take away our homes when it's profitable.

        "description": "On this day in 1953, in what became an uprising of more than one million people, 300 East German construction workers protested at government buildings, demanding the reversal of a 10% increase in work quotas.\n\nDue to an economic slump, the East German government had increased worker quotas (called \"norms\") by 10% across all state-owned factories. At the same time, the prices of food, health care, and public transportation had all significantly increased, leading to an effective monthly wage cut of 33%.\n\nAlthough the government quickly conceded on the matter of work quotas, the protests took on an anti-government character and spread quickly throughout all of East Germany. News of the initial strike had spread both through word of mouth and was strongly amplified by the Western \"Radio in the American Sector\" (RIAS), which provided sympathetic coverage of the protests.\n\nSoviet troops and tanks entered East Berlin on the morning of June 17th and violently clashed with the protesters, who had stormed government headquarters. The East German Stasi engaged in mass arrests of thousands of people and executed dozens more. Around 130 people were killed during the uprising, the vast majority of the dead being demonstrators.\n\nFollowing the successful repression of the uprising, many workers lost faith in East Germany's socialist state. The ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) lost many members as a result. In response to the rebellion, the East German state expanded its surveillance of workers to more closely monitor discontent, leading to what journalist Chris Hedges called \"the most efficient security and surveillance state\" of its time.",

Afrikaans was strongly associated with apartheid (prominent anti-apartheid activist Desmond Tutu called it \"the language of the oppressor\"), and this decree was widely resented.\n\nAt first, resistance to the measure was scattered - on April 30th, the students of Orlando West Junior School went on strike, and other schools began to follow suit. Students eventually formed an Action Committee, later known as the Soweto Students' Representative Council, which organized a mass meeting on June 13th to develop a cohesive strategy of protest.\n\nOn the morning on June 16th, 10,000-20,000 students walked out of their schools to a mass rally, carrying signs reading \"Down with Afrikaans\", \"Viva Azania\", and \"If we must do Afrikaans, Vorster must do Zulu\".\n\nThe protest turned violent after students killed a trained dog that the police had sicced on them, causing the police to open fire. Among the first students to be murdered were the 15-year-old Hastings Ndlovu and the 12-year-old Hector Pieterson (shown, photo by Sam Nzima).\n\nSocial reformer Dr. Melville Edelstein was beaten to death by the mob, a sign around his neck proclaiming, \"Beware Afrikaans is the most dangerous drug for our future\". 23 people died on the first day in Soweto, and hundreds more were killed in the following weeks.\n\nEmergency clinics were swamped with injured and bloody children. Police requested for the hospital to provide a list of all victims with bullet wounds, however the doctors refused, recording bullet wounds as abscesses.\n\nThe violence led to widespread riots and sympathy protests throughout South Africa, including white students from the University of the Witwatersrand. In remembrance of these events, June 16th is now a public holiday in South Africa known as Youth Day.",

Angelo and his father also left Italy in October 1924, living in France, Luxembourg, and Belgium, where Angelo worked as a miner and a machine hand.\n\nWhile working as a miner, he joined the anarchist committee of Liege, and was active in the activities to bring about the general strike in Belgium in solidarity with framed Italian-American anarchists Sacco and Vanzetti.\n\nAlready under surveillance as a suspected communist subversive, Sbardellotto was stopped by police in Piazza Venezia, Rome in 1932 and was found to be armed with two rudimentary bombs and a pistol, as well as possession of a Swiss passport.\n\nAdmitting to having entered Italy clandestinely with the intent of avenging socialist Michael Schirru by killing Mussolini (Schirru himself had attempted to assassinate Mussolini), he was interrogated and likely tortured by police before his trial a week later on June 11th.\n\nWhen Sbardellotto's lawyer requested that he write to Mussolini directly to ask for his life to be spared, he refused, stating that he was only sorry that he had not carried out the attempt on Mussolini. On June 17th, 1932, at twenty-four years old, he was put in front of the firing squad at the Bretta Fort. He refused last rites from a priest.

His father worked on ships that transported enslaved Africans to the Caribbean and the Americas, and these stories convinced him slavery had to be abolished.\n\nThompson became one of the most prominent and influential abolitionists and human rights lecturers in the United Kingdom and the United States. He was friends with Frederick Douglass and met with Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War. On one visit to the United States, Thompson had to flee the country due to threats of violence from pro-slavery parties.\n\nThompson was also an advocate of free trade, Chartism, nonresistance, the peace movement, and East Indian reform, helping form the British India Society in 1839 to advocate for more ethical capitalist practices there.",

She graduated from medical training for paramedics and housewives the day before the German invasion of the Soviet Union. During fighting in her hometown, a wounded Soviet soldier she had been taking care of asked her why the city didn't have a strong partisan movement.\n\nWhen the soldier recovered, Kislyak contacted several partisans hiding out in a nearby forest and asked if she could join their cause, recruiting several acquaintances into the movement. With this organization, she helped kill Nazi officers, sometimes flirting with them to lure them into an isolated area where they could be killed out of sight.\n\nWhen she received word that a Gestapo agent nicknamed \"the Butcher\" would be coming to Kharkiv, she and her partisan unit spent two days planning his capture. Kislyak rented a room right next to his at the farm he was staying at.\n\nAfter courting him for a few days she lured him to a riverbank, where her conspirators captured him. After interrogating the officer, the group summarily executed him with a crowbar.\n\nIn response, more than one hundred villagers, including Mariya, were collectively arrested by the Gestapo and told they would be killed by a firing squad if the SS man wasn't found alive soon. After the plot became known, Mariya and two others were brutally tortured and interrogated for weeks.\n\nOn June 18th, the group of three was hanged and their bodies put on public display. On May 8th, 1965 she was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union.",

The action was taken after a near unanimous vote from more than 1,000 miners the same day.\n\nOn June 22nd, mine owners in the area banded together, agreeing to a district-wide worker lockout and signing a secret agreement to maintain a unified front against the union: none of them would recognize the union or negotiate with it, and that no participant would agree to any concessions except by majority vote of the owners.\n\nLeadville mine owner John Campion hired labor spies from both the Thiel Detective Agency and the Pinkerton Agency to spy on the union. Campion hired additional spies to report on activities of replacement workers imported from Missouri. The owners used their spies to develop a blacklist and exploit divisions among the striking workers.\n\nAt the time the WFM was associated with the American Federation of Labor (AFL), a more moderate union. Other WFM locals, particularly the Butte, Montana local, sent financial support to the strikers, but the AFL refused to provide both financial support and to call other union locals out in sympathy strikes.\n\nOn September 21st, a group of approximately 50 armed strikers began a series of pre-meditated attacks on mines in the area, attempting to destroy them with bombs and a homemade cannon. Four miners, all found to be members of the WFM, were killed, along with one fireman. This led to widespread arrests of WFM members and the arrival of the National Guard to the area.\n\nThe strike was defeated on March 9th, 1897. The failure of the strike to succeed caused the WFM to leave the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and turn towards more radical anti-capitalist politics. The WFM would go on to play a key role in founding the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in 1905.",

        "description": "The Herrin Massacre began on this day in 1922 in Illinois when striking coal miners looted ammunition and guns from a hardware store and laid siege to their mine, filled with strikebreakers, killing twenty-three people. Depiction of the massacre shown is by Paul Cadmus.\n\nThe violence took place in a coal mining area during a nationwide strike called months prior by the United Mineworkers of America (UMWA). The owner of the local Illinois mine, W.J. Lester, negotiated with the union to allow his mine to remain open and for miners to go back to work, as long as no coal was shipped out.\n\nBy June, over 60,000 tons of coal had been dug up and Lester decided to break his agreement and attempted to sell the coal. Early in the morning of June 21st, a truck carrying Lester's guards and strikebreakers was ambushed near Carbondale, Illinois on its way to the mine. The union miners marched into Herrin, looted the hardware store of its firearms and ammunition, and laid siege to the mine.\n\nThe strikebreakers working in the mine surrendered to the union workers firing on them and were captured as prisoners. Despite promises of safety, they were brutally tortured and massacred by the union miners. Twenty-three workers were killed, most of whom were members of the strikebreaking group. W.J. Lester, the owner of the mine, made a significant profit from selling his mine after the massacre occurred.",

        "description": "On this day in 1877, ten members of the Molly Maguires, a secretive Irish-American society associated with militant labor struggle, were executed in Pennsylvania on the basis of dubious evidence from an undercover Pinkerton agent.\n\nAfter the Great Panic of 1873, mine owners imposed a new contract on the workforce which lowered pay rates by 10-20%. This led to the Long Strike of 1875, which lasted seven months and compelled the governor order in troops to the region.\n\nWhen the Long Strike failed, some Irish-American miners turned to tactics that had been employed in Ireland in the late 17th and 18th centuries - using oath bound societies, anonymous threats and in some cases violent retribution on those deemed hostile to their community. The Molly Maguires society emerged from this historical backdrop.\n\nIn 1876-77, twenty suspected Molly Maguires were convicted of murder and other crimes on the basis of very dubious evidence (mostly testimony from notorious Pinkerton Agent James McParland).\n\nIt was on this day in 1877 that six of the convicted men were hanged in the prison at Pottsville, and four at Mauch Chunk, Carbon County (modern day Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania). American labor historian Philip Foner concluded that the men were likely framed due to their labor activism.",

Until January 1st, 1867, the bill specified, only free black people and loyal white people would be allowed access to these lands. Homesteaders were required to occupy and improve the land for five years before acquiring full ownership.\n\nSouthern bureaucrats often obstructed or violated the law, not informing black people of their right to land (thus delaying and allowing Confederates to be eligible, from 1867 onwards). It was also difficult for freed slaves to take advantage of the opportunity, often lacking seed, animals, and farm tools.\n\nDespite this, free black people entered about 6,500 claims to homesteads, 1,000 of which eventually resulted in property certificates. The law was repealed a decade later as part of a growing cooperation between Northern and Southern capitalists. This cooperation became more explicit with the Compromise of 1877, which resulted in the end of Reconstruction and federal troops withdrawing from Southern states.",

In sections of the city, hundreds of barricades were thrown up. The National Guard was sent in to quell the rebellion, and workers seized weapons from local armories to fight back.\n\nThe violence, which lasted just three days, resulted in more than 10,000 casualties and 4,000 participants to be deported to Algeria. Among the dead was Denis Auguste Affre, Archbishop of Paris, killed while trying to negotiate peace with an angry crowd.\n\nThe rebellion was successfully crushed, and the episode put a hold on revolutionary ambitions of radical Republicans at the time. In its aftermath, French Constitution of 1848 was adopted, mandating that executive power be wielded by a democratically elected president. The first president under this framework was Napoleon Bonaparte, who dissolved the constitution during his first term in office.",

Truman, with many Democrats defecting from the party line to support the union-busting measure.\n\nThe Act was introduced in the aftermath of a major, unprecedented wave of strikes in the aftermath of World War II, from 1945-1946. Strikes were strongly repressed during World War II so as to not hamper the war effect. When the wartime restrictions ended, millions of workers across the country went on strike.\n\nThe Taft-Hartley Act prohibits unions from engaging in \"unfair labor practices.\" Among the practices prohibited by the act are jurisdictional strikes, wildcat strikes, solidarity or political strikes, secondary boycotts, secondary and mass picketing, closed shops, and monetary donations by unions to federal political campaigns. The NLRA also allowed states to pass right-to-work laws banning union shops.\n\nA pamphlet supporting a third, progressive party, published in 1948, had this to say on the vote:\n\n\"Every scheme of the lobbyists to fleece the public became law in the 80th Congress. And every constructive proposal to benefit the common people gathered dust in committee pigeonholes. The bi-partisan bloc, the Republocratic cabal which ruled Congress and made a mockery of President Roosevelt's economic bill of rights, also wrecked the Roosevelt foreign policy. A new foreign policy was developed. This policy was still gilded with the good words of democracy. But its Holy Grail was oil...\n\nThe Democratic administration carries the ball for Wall Street's foreign policy. And the Republican party carries the ball for Wall Street's domestic policy. Of course the roles are sometimes interchangeable...\n\nOn occasion President Truman still likes to lay an occasional verbal wreath on the grave of the New Deal. But the hard facts of roll call votes show that Democrats are voting more and more like Republicans. If the Republican Taft-Hartley bill became law over the President's veto, it was because many of the Democrats allied themselves to the Republicans.\"",

A few weeks after the uprising, a Roman Catholic priest died after being beaten by police, having joined the rioters and criticized the government in his sermons.\n\nDespite the government crackdown, the price raises were reversed within 24 hours.

        "description": "Carl Braden, born on this day in 1914, was a left-wing trade unionist, journalist, and activist who was charged with sedition by the state of Kentucky after purchasing a home in an all-white neighborhood on behalf of a black family. He was married to Anne Braden, a prominent civil rights activist in her own right.\n\nIn 1954, to sidestep the residential race segregation in Louisville, Kentucky, the Bradens purchased a house in an all-white neighborhood and deeded it over to the Wades, an African-American family who had been unsuccessfully seeking a suburban residence. White segregationists responded by burning a cross in the yard, shooting into the home, and eventually destroying the building entirely with dynamite.\n\nFor his role in the affair, Carl Braden was charged with sedition, his work for racial integration being interpreted as an act of communist subversion. He was convicted on December 13th, 1954 and sentenced to fifteen years in prison.\n\nImmediately upon his conviction, he was fired from his job and blacklisted from local employment. Braden served seven months of his sentence before he was released on a $40,000 bond, the highest bond ever set in Kentucky up to that time.\n\nOn appeal, his case made it to the Supreme Court (Braden v. United States, 1961), which ruled that Braden's conviction was constitutional, although it was later overturned. In 1967, the Bradens were again charged with sedition for protesting the practice of strip-mining in Pike County, Kentucky.",

The event, also known as the Battle of the Greasy Grass, was one of the most significant military actions in the Great Sioux War.\n\nThe battle began on the morning of June 25th when Colonel Custer led an attack on an encampment of combined tribes. His strategy was to seize as many \"non-combatants\" as possible (i.e., women, the disabled, and children), and force the men to surrender to protect their families.\n\nCuster drastically underestimated the amount of indigenous people present, however, and no member of his attacking battalion survived their charge on the camp. Despite the victory, the seizure of indigenous lands continued unabated. Days after the battle, Crazy Horse (a leader in the Sioux resistance) surrendered to the government and died in state custody.\n\nAs a result of the Battle of Little Bighorn, the U.S. government threatened to withhold all food aid to reservations if the Sioux did not cease hostilities and cede South Dakota land. Threatened with starvation, they complied in 1877.",

Among his most famous works are his allegory for the Soviet Union \"Animal Farm\" (1945) and the dystopian novel \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" (1949). Orwell is also noted for his first hand-account of the Spanish Civil War, \"Homage to Catalonia\" (1938).\n\nIn \"Homage to Catalonia\", Orwell writes about fighting for the Republican faction, describing in detail the ways in which the anarchist movement re-structured their economy and military to be more egalitarian. He was shot in the throat but survived, declared unfit for service, and returned to England to recover.\n\nOrwell's experiences with anarchist and Bolshevik movements in Catalonia made him a vehement anti-communist later in life. In 1949, shortly before he died, Orwell prepared a list of notable people he considered unsuitable as possible writers for the anti-communist propaganda activities of the British government.\n\nThe action drew widespread criticism from other left-wing figures; Scottish journalist Alexander Cockburn referred to the notebook as \"a snitch list\" and noted Orwell's homophobia and racist comments on various individuals on the list as demonstrative of his bigotry.\n\nDespite his vehement opposition to the Soviet Union and associated communist movements, Orwell continued to identify as a democratic socialist and authored essays such as \"The Lion and the Unicorn: Socialism and the English Genius\" (1940) that advocated for socialism in the United Kingdom.",

Kennedy's inaugural address, Meredith decided to exercise his constitutional rights and apply to the University of Mississippi, hoping to put pressure on the Kennedy administration to enforce civil rights for African Americans.\n\nIn 1966, Meredith planned a solo 220-mile March Against Fear from Memphis, Tennessee, to Jackson, Mississippi, in protest of racial discrimination in voter registration. The second day, he was shot by a white sniper. Leaders of civil rights organizations and unions, including Martin Luther King Jr. and Walter Reuther, vowed to complete the march in his name after he was taken to the hospital.\n\nWhile Meredith was recovering, more people from across the country became involved as marchers. When the estimated 15,000 marchers reached Jackson, Mississippi, with Meredith on its front lines, it became the largest civil rights march in Mississippi history.",

A convention was held of 200 socialists and radical trade unionists from all over the United States who opposed the policies and politics of the American Federation of Labor (AFL). In particular, the IWW opposed the American Federation of Labor's acceptance of capitalism and its refusal to include unskilled workers in craft unions.\n\nThe IWW's founders included many historically important labor activists and socialist thinkers, including Big Bill Haywood, James Connolly, Daniel De Leon, Eugene V. Debs, Thomas Hagerty, Lucy Parsons, Mary Harris \"Mother\" Jones, Frank Bohn, William Trautmann, Vincent Saint John, Ralph Chaplin, and many others.",

She and anarchist writer Alexander Berkman, her lover and lifelong friend, planned to assassinate industrialist and financier Henry Clay Frick as an act of \"propaganda of the deed\".\n\nFrick survived the attempt on his life, and Berkman was sentenced to 22 years in prison. Goldman was imprisoned several times in the years that followed for \"inciting to riot\" and illegally distributing information about birth control.\n\nAfter their release from prison, Goldman and Berkman were again arrested and deported to Russia. Initially supportive of the October Revolution that brought the Bolsheviks to power, Goldman changed her opinion in the wake of the Kronstadt rebellion, denouncing the Soviet Union for its repression of political dissent. She left the Soviet Union and, in 1923, published a book about her experiences, \"My Disillusionment in Russia\".\n\nGoldman was an extremely well-known anarchist in her lifetime, with a reputation as a powerful orator. Her writing and lectures spanned a wide variety of issues, including prisons, atheism, freedom of speech, militarism, capitalism, free love, and homosexuality.\n\n\"If I can't dance, I don't want to be part of your revolution.\"\n\n- Emma Goldman",

In a 1924 letter to a U.S. Senator, Keller wrote \"So long as I confine my activities to social service and the blind, they compliment me extravagantly, calling me 'arch priestess of the sightless,' 'wonder woman,' and a 'modern miracle.'

As Nikita Kruschev was pushing \"de-Stalinization\" reforms, there were growing debates in Poland about the country's political future.\n\nWorkers in the largest factory of Poznan, Cegielski's Metal Industries, were disgruntled, wanting lower taxes and work quotas. When the government reneged on promises made to these workers on June 26th, 80% of the factory workers walked out on the morning on June 28th.\n\nThe strike quickly grew into a massive protest, with more than 100,000 protesters surrounding the Imperial Castle in Poznan. The demonstrators demanded lower food prices, wage increases, better working conditions, and to meet with Polish Prime Minister J\u00f3zef Cyrankiewicz. Some police officers joined the crowd.\n\nThe protest escalated into a full-blown riot as workers stormed a local prison and arms depot. The crowd clashed with state forces and ransacked many government buildings, including the local Communist Party headquarters, the office of the Ministry of Public Security, courthouse, prosecutor's office, and multiple police stations.\n\nThe rebellion was crushed by the Polish Army occupying Poznan with more than 10,000 troops, tanks, armored cars, and field guns. Several hundred people were arrested in the following weeks, many of whom were workers. At least fifty (some estimates say more than seventy) people were killed, including a thirteen year old boy. Several hundred more were wounded.\n\nThe uprising contributed to the Polish October (or \"Gomu\u0142ka Thaw\"), in which Poland's government temporarily liberalized and won more autonomy from Soviet control. Although some historians view the revolt as precipitating the fall of communism in Poland, the demands of the protesters themselves were economic, not anti-communist, in character.\n\nOn June 21st, 2006, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the events, the Polish parliament declared June 28th to be a national holiday in Poland - the \"Day of Remembrance\".",

In 1917, Gerber was briefly committed to a mental institution because of his homosexuality.\n\nWhen the U.S. declared war on Germany, Gerber was forced to choose between becoming interned as an enemy alien or enlist in the Army. Gerber chose the latter and served in the Army for approximately three years.\n\nDuring his time in Germany, Gerber learned about the sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld's advocacy to decriminalize and normalize homosexuality. He also traveled to Berlin, which had a thriving gay subculture.\n\nInspired by Hirschfeld's work, on December 10th, 1924, Gerber founded the Society for Human Rights, the first pro-gay organization in the United States. A black clergyman named John T. Graves signed on as the organization's first president while Gerber and six others were listed as directors.\n\nGerber set out to expand the Society's membership beyond the original seven, but had difficulty interesting anyone other than working class queer people in joining. More affluent members of Chicago's gay community refused to join his society, not wanting to ruin their reputations by being associated with homosexuality.\n\nThe Society was only a chartered organization for a few months before police arrested Gerber and several other members. Gerber was subjected to three highly publicized trials, and his defense, while ultimately successful, cost him his life savings.\n\nUnable to continue funding the Society, the group dismantled, and Gerber left for New York City, embittered that the more affluent gays of Chicago had not come to his aid for a cause he believed was designed to advance the common good.\n\n\"Is not the psychiatrist again putting the cart before the horse in saying that homosexuality is a symptom of the neurotic style of life? Would it not sound more natural to say that the homosexual is made neurotic because his style of life is beset by thousands of dangers?\"\n\n- Henry Gerber",

        "description": "On this day in 1960, the Republic of the Congo became independent from Belgian colonizers, beginning a four year period of civil war which killed approximately 100,000 people, including the country's first Prime Minister, Patrice Lumumba. The complex period of political strife is known as the \"Congo Crisis\".\n\nThe Congo had been colonized by Belgium since the late 19th century, a process initiated by King Leopold II of Belgium, who was frustrated by Belgium's lack of international power and prestige.\n\nA nationalist movement within the Belgian Congo began to gain momentum in the 1950s, consisting of rival factions such as the Mouvement National Congolais (MNC), of which Patrice Lumumba (shown) was a leading figure, and Alliance des Bakongo (ABAKO), led by Joseph Kasa-Vubu.\n\nFollowing major riots in Stanleyville and L\u00e9opoldville in 1959, a Round Table Conference in Brussels was held in January 1960, with leaders from all the major Congolese parties in attendance.\n\nThe Congolese leaders were successful in negotiating their independence to be granted within months, formally winning their independence from Belgium in late June. Within days, violence between white and black communities broke out, and the country descended into a civil war between rival political factions. Some factions, supported by powerful mining interests, began seceding from the newly founded Republic of Congo.\n\nThe United Nations sent in peacekeeping troops, which were initially welcomed by Lumumba and the central government with the idea that the UN would help suppress the secessionist states. Viewing the secessions as an internal political matter, the UN refused to use its troops to assist the central Congolese government against them.\n\nLumumba also sought the assistance of the U.S. government, led by Dwight D. Eisenhower, who refused to provide meaningful military aid. He then turned to the Soviet Union, which agreed to provide weapons, logistical and material support, which the state promptly used against the secessionists.\n\nDespite Lumumba's public proclamations that he was not a communist, the United States viewed the acceptance of aid with alarm, and Lumumba became a target of Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) surveillance. Lumumba was captured and, on January 17th, 1961, executed by Belgian-assisted forces.\n\nThe factional conflict continued in the wake of Lumumba's death, with fighting and intervention coming from Western states, the United Nations, and various political groups inside the Congo.\n\nIn 1964, a group known as the Simbas initiated a rebellion based on egalitarian ideals and witchcraft. In November 1964, the Simbas rounded up the remaining white population of Stanleyville, holding them hostage in the Victoria Hotel to use as bargaining tools with the Arm\u00e9e Nationale Congolaise (ANC).\n\nIn order to recover the hostages, Belgian parachute troops were flown to the Congo in American aircraft. More than 70 hostages and 1,000 Congolese civilians were killed in the rescue mission, but the vast majority of hostages were evacuated.\n\nFollowing chaotic elections in 1964, Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mobutu took power in a military coup, assuming sweeping powers and instituting widespread political repression. Mobutu, who had played a key role in Lumumba's execution, ruled until 1997, enjoying support from the United States, France, Belgium, and Maoist China.",

After they established an encampment, a band of lepers led by indigenous Hawaiian man Ko'olau (shown, with his family) seized the camp, and chased the lawmen back to the coast. The following day Ko'olau shot Stoltz dead while he was attempting to arrest a man named Paoa.\n\nOn July 1st, 1893, fifteen soldiers landed in Kalalau Valley, initally without incident. Over the next two weeks, Ko'olau, along with his wife Pi'ilani, led a campaign of guerilla warfare against state forces, compelling them to give up due to their inability to Ko'olau or evade his group's attacks.\n\nTwenty seven lepers were captured and sent to Kalawao, while the remaining lepers were never harassed again. The leper community dissolved, living in individual households.\n\nKo'olau and his family remained unharmed, but hid in the valley for the remainder of his life. After Ko'olau's death, his wife Pi'ilani left the valley to share their story, which was published in 1906 as Ka Moolelo oiaio o Kaluaikoolau (\"The True Story of Kaluaikoolau\").",

When the agents tried to land, gunfire erupted, killing four people and injuring twenty-three on both sides. The Pinkertons surrendered, and many were beaten unconscious after leaving the boat.\n\nThe strike was forcibly put down by state militia, resulting in a defeat for the workers. The Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers collapsed, and its workers returned in August.\n\nFor his role in breaking the union, anarchists Alexander Berkman and Emma Goldman unsuccessfully attempted to assassinate Henry Clay Frick.",

A major obstacle to the success of this forgery was the Municipal Office for Population Registration, an Amsterdam office that contained millions of identifying records for Jews and others wanted by the Gestapo.\n\nArondeus and other members of the resistance bombed the office on March 27th, 1943, subduing the guards via injection, and succeeding in destroying approximately 800,000 documents.

On June 18th, Arondeus and fourteen others were tried and sentenced to death. Ardoneus pleaded guilty and took the full blame, which may have contributed to two members receiving clemency.\n\nBefore his execution, Arondeus made a point of ensuring the public would be aware that he and two other men in the group were gay, asking an acquaintance to \"Tell the people that homosexuals can be brave!\".

Ideologically an African nationalist and pan-Africanist, he led the Congolese National Movement (MNC) party from 1958 until his assassination on January 17th, 1961 in a coup by Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mobutu, backed by Belgian colonizers.\n\nLumumba did not express a pro-capitalist or pro-communist ideology, attempting to remain neutral in Cold War politics. He sought assistance in stabilizing the new Congolese Republic from both the United States and the Soviet Union, accepting military aid from the latter after the U.S. refused to help him.\n\nOn Lumumba's legacy, his friend and colleague Thomas Kanza wrote \"he lived as a free man, and an independent thinker. Everything he wrote, said and did was the product of someone who knew his vocation to be that of a liberator, and he represents for the Congo what Castro does for Cuba, Nasser for Egypt, Nkrumah for Ghana, Mao Tse-tung for China, and Lenin for Russia.\"",

Because of the ban placed on socialist activity in Germany by Bismarck in 1878, Zetkin left for Zurich in 1882 then went into exile in Paris, where she studied to be a journalist and a translator.\n\nZetkin was very interested in women's politics, including the fight for equal opportunities and women's suffrage, though always through a socialist paradigm. She helped to develop the social-democratic women's movement in Germany; from 1891 to 1917 she edited the Social Democratic Party (SPD) women's newspaper Die Gleichheit (Equality). She also contributed to International Women's Day (IWD).\n\nAround 1898, Zetkin formed a friendship with the younger Rosa Luxemburg that lasted 20 years. Despite Luxemburg's indifference to the women's movement, they became staunch political allies on the far left of the SPD. Luxemburg once suggested that their joint epitaph would be \"Here lie the last two men of German Social Democracy.\"\n\nIn August 1932, despite having recently fallen gravely ill in Moscow, she returned to Berlin to preside over the opening of the newly elected Reichstag. There, she gave a speech urging Germany to reject fascism, stating \"all those who feel themselves threatened, all those who suffer and all those who long for liberation must belong to the United Front against fascism and its representatives in government\".\n\nWhen Hitler seized power the following year, Zetkin once again fled Germany, dying in Moscow in 1933 at the age of 76.\n\n\"The working women, who aspire to social equality, expect nothing for their emancipation from the bourgeois women's movement, which allegedly fights for the rights of women. That edifice is built on sand and has no real basis. Working women are absolutely convinced that the question of the emancipation of women is not an isolated question which exists in itself, but part of the great social question.\"\n\n- Clara Zetkin",

        "description": "Frida Kahlo, born on this day in 1907, was a Mexican artist and communist known for her folk-art inspired style paintings, touching on themes on gender, race, class, self-perception, indigenous culture, and chronic pain.\n\nAlthough she had always sketched as a hobby, she did not consider visual art as a career until a  severe bus accident at the age of eighteen left her bedridden for three months and with a lifetime of chronic pain. Confined to her bed, Kahlo's mother provided her with a specially-made easel, which enabled her to paint while lying down.\n\nWith a mirror placed such so that she could see herself, Kahlo began to paint self-portraits, stating \"I paint myself because I am often alone and I am the subject I know best\".\n\nInspired by Mexico's popular culture, she employed an accessible, folk art style. In 1943, Kahlo accepted a teaching position at the Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado, the \"La Esmeralda.\" She encouraged her students to treat her in an informal and non-hierarchical way and taught them to appreciate Mexican popular culture and folk art, and to derive their subjects from the street.\n\nFrida Kahlo was a member of the Mexican Communist Party and committed to radical anti-capitalism throughout her entire adult life. In 1951, she stated:\n\n\"I have a great restlessness about my paintings. Mainly because I want to make it useful to the revolutionary communist movement...until now I have managed simply an honest expression of my own self...I must struggle with all my strength to ensure that the little positive my health allows me to do also benefits the Revolution, the only real reason to live.\"",

At the time, approximately one out of six children under the age of sixteen were employed, according to the 1900 census.\n\nThe march began when Mother Jones tried to get newspapers to report on the conditions of child workers and they informed her that they would not run the stories about child labor because of the mill owners holding stock in the papers. Jones replied \"Well, I've got stock in these little children and I'll arrange a little publicity.\"\n\nThe march successfully won that publicity, bringing national attention to the plight of working children. On July 29th, Jones and fellow marchers arrived at Roosevelt's Sagamore Hill summer home, where he refused to meet with them.\n\nAlthough the strike was initially a failure, it galvanized support for anti-child labor laws to be passed on the national level, which finally occurred with the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.",

Between this and other anti-labor crackdowns, approximately 200 members were arrested.\n\nThis suppression took place in the context of a broader political struggle against the state which was spearheaded by the union. A year earlier, the Norwegian Workers Association had delivered a petition, signed by more than 13,000 people, to King Oscar II of Sweden, demanding equality before the law, military conscription to be extended to property owners, and universal suffrage. When the government dismissed the petition, the union began agitating for revolution.\n\nThe Workers Association was one of the first major labor movements in Norway. It was founded by Marcus Thrane in 1848, who was inspired by the ongoing revolution in France. The association grew rapidly through 1849 and 1850.\n\nAt its peak, the group boasted 273 chapters and 25,000-30,000 members. Following the crackdown and Thrane's imprisonment, the movement collapsed.",

        "description": "On this day in 1912, the Grabow Riot began in Grabow, Louisiana when gunfire was exchanged between organizing lumber workers and private gunmen hired by the Galloway Lumber Company, just one event in the Louisiana-Texas Lumber War. The clash left three union workers and one company gunman dead, wounding an estimated fifty more.\n\nThe event took place in the context of workers in the sawmill town of Grabow joining the Brotherhood of Timber Workers (shown), a branch of the Lumber Workers Industrial Union (LWIU), itself affiliated with the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW).\n\nOn July 7th, 1912, the union workers held a series of rallies at several different company towns, including Bon Ami and Carson, alongside Grabow.\n\nThe group that went to Grabow, around 200 people, spontaneously decided to hold a rally with several speeches - labor leader Arthur L. Emerson spoke on top of a wagon to roughly 25 non-union men, plus the additional union men who had come with him.\n\nShots began between these workers and a group of four others, including Galloway Lumber owner John Galloway, in the local mill office, all of whom had later been found to be drinking before the incident. It is not known for certain which group fired first. Three union men were killed alongside one member of the private company security force. Approximately 50 more were wounded.\n\nOver the next few days, more than more than 60 workers were taken into custody by police. Although the mill owner himself was arrested, he was released without charges soon afterward. Sixty-five of the timber workers' group were brought up on charges ranging from inciting a riot to murder.\n\nThe IWW worked to aid the incarcerated workers, with \"Big Bill\" Haywood fundraising for their legal fund. The trial lasted until November 8th, and its jury returned a not guilty verdict for all of the union men. All of those arrested were set free.\n\nAlthough they had limited success in Louisiana, the LWIU successfully organized later, winning an eight-hour day and vastly improved working conditions in the Pacific Northwest after a 1917 strike. Today, there is a historical marker at the site of the riot, located on what is now the property of DeRidder Airport, Louisiana.",

More than 4,000 miners stayed off the job, but soon the protest grew to more than 10,000 people.\n\nMine owners responded to the strike by increasing their use of slave prison labor, deputizing hundreds of armed men to confront workers, and urging Governor Braxton Bragg Comer to declare martial law and dispatch state troops into the coalfields, a request he eventually granted.\n\nEvicted from company housing, thousands of workers were forced to live in tent cities, which were later attacked by state troops.\n\nThe strike was also notable for the union's ability to unite miners across the racial divide, a development that was unusual for the United States in this period. A parade of striking black and white miners through the streets of Jasper angered members of Birmingham's business community, who denounced the UMW's interracial workforce as an insult to southern traditions and called for armed state intervention against the racially mixed strikers.\n\nIn mid-August, black UMW member William Millin was snatched from his jail cell and lynched by two mine deputies.\n\nThe strike was effectively put down after state troops destroyed the miners' tent cities on August 26th, and was officially called off by the union four days later. One year afterward, the mines' production had returned to normal.",

These non-combatants were described as \"political infrastructure\" for the VC.\n\nThe Phoenix Program \"neutralized\" 81,740 people suspected of VC membership, of whom 26,369 were killed, the rest either surrendered or captured. The program was controversial even with the U.S. security state, with one former U.S. military intelligence officer describing it as a \"sterile depersonalized murder program\".\n\nThere were widespread reports of torture and murder of prisoners and, because the program targeted apparent civilians, many innocent people were killed. In some cases, Vietnamese people would report their enemies as Viet Cong in order to get U.S. troops to kill them.\n\nAfter the program's abuses began receiving negative publicity, it was officially shut down in 1971, although the program continued under the name \"Plan F-6\", with the government of South Vietnam placed in control.",

She took an early interest in becoming educated, and later became a big exponent of education within the black community. She started a school for African-American girls that later, after merging with a boys' school, became known as the \"Bethune-Cookman School\" and served as its president on multiple occasions.\n\nFor her lifetime of activism, Bethune was deemed \"First Lady of Negro America\" by Ebony magazine in 1949, and was also known by the black press as the \"female Booker T.

        "description": "On this day in 1985, the French government, in an act of state-sponsored terror, bombed the Greenpeace-operated boat Rainbow Warrior, which was en route to protest a nuclear weapons test planned by the French state. The bombing, later found to be personally ordered by French President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, killed a freelance photographer on board named Fernando Pereira.\n\nFrance had been testing nuclear weapons on the Mururoa Atoll in French Polynesia since 1966. In 1985 eight South Pacific countries, including New Zealand and Australia, signed a treaty declaring the region a nuclear-free zone.\n\nSince being acquired by Greenpeace in 1977, Rainbow Warrior was active in supporting a number of anti-nuclear testing campaigns during the late 1970s and early 1980s, including relocating 300 Marshall Islanders from Rongelap Atoll, which had been polluted by radioactive fallout by past American nuclear tests\n\nFor the 1985 tests, Greenpeace intended to monitor the impact of nuclear tests and place protesters on the island to observe the blasts. Three undercover French agents were on board, however, and they attached two limpet mines to Rainbow Warrior and detonated them ten minutes apart, sinking the ship.\n\nFrance initially denied responsibility, but two of the French agents were captured by New Zealand Police and charged with arson, conspiracy to commit arson, willful damage, and murder.\n\nThe resulting scandal led to the resignation of the French Defence Minister Charles Hernu, while the two agents pleaded guilty to manslaughter and were sentenced to ten years in prison. They spent a little over two years confined to the French island of Hao before being freed by the French government.\n\nIn 1987, after international pressure, France paid $8.16m to Greenpeace in damages, which helped finance another ship. It also paid compensation to the Pereira family, making reparation payments of 650,000 francs to Pereira's wife, 1.5 million francs to his two children, and 75,000 francs to each of his parents.",

Approximately three dozen Cheyenne were killed, including some elderly, women, and children.\n\nOne U.S. soldier later recalled the murder of a fifteen year old boy, who died fighting the colonizers while the women and children attempted to escape.\n\nThe attack was a decisive victory for the United States and effectively put an end to the Dog Soldier raids. For their part, the Pawnee Scouts would later go on to play role in the Great Sioux War, fighting again as mercenaries for the U.S. The Scouts permanently disbanded after that war's conclusion.",

This solidarity between unskilled and skilled labor (a principle known as industrial unionism) was notable for the era.\n\nOn the morning of July 11th, gunfire erupted between striking workers and scabs working in the mines.

He chose the former. Before the day was over, six people were killed and dozens were wounded.\n\nFollowing this violence, martial law was declared in Coeur d'Alene and the town was under military rule by the Idaho National Guard for four months.\n\nHundreds of miners were illegally detained without hearings or formal charges. The event was disastrous for the local miners' union. In an effort to reorganize the workforce, the Western Federation of Miners (WFM) was founded the following year.",

When cops started pepper spraying, the picketers pushed back.\n\nThe next day, longshoremen from the major Northwest ports, Seattle, Tacoma and Portland, seeing images of the ILWU president being manhandled by cops, stopped work and began destroying EGT property.\n\nAccording to news reports, the cyclone fence was torn down, grain was dumped from the train cars, and the terminal was briefly occupied by angry longshore workers. Millions of dollars were lost in shipping, warning employers how far ILWU members were willing to go to protect their jobs.",

MLK Jr. was elected to lead the boycott as president, Nixon was elected treasurer. When some participants suggested forming a secret organization, Nixon stated \"Am I to tell our people that you are cowards?\"\n\nIn 1957, after the boycott's success, Nixon left the MIA to protest his own treatment as a newcomer, and what perceived as the domination of the MIA by middle class leaders who refused to share power with low income black people.\n\nHe also expressed resentment that King and Abernathy had received most of the credit for the boycott, as opposed to the local activists like himself who had already spent years organizing against segregation.\n\nDespite this, King paid homage to Nixon, calling him \"a symbol of the hopes and aspirations of the long oppressed people of the State of Alabama.\"",

They also resented that the wealthy, who could afford to pay a $300 (equivalent to $6,200 in 2019) commutation fee to hire a substitute and avoid the draft.\n\nAlthough the event ostensibly began as anger against conscription, the disorder quickly devolved into a race riot. The exact death toll during the New York draft riots is unknown, but historian James M. McPherson has estimated that around 120 people were killed. Most of those killed were Irish, who were the majority of the rioters.\n\nEleven black people were lynched. The event lasted three days and was suppressed by the U.S. Army on orders from President Lincoln. The race riot remains one of the largest of its kind in U.S. history.",

The strike took place at the nickel mine in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, which accounts for a large share of the world's nickel supply.\n\nAfter the miners walked out, the United Steelworkers (USW) permitted 56 skilled members from the USW Local 2020 to scab on the strike, allowing Vale to restart minimal mine operations.\n\nVale also hired a \"security firm\", AFI, to spy on and harass striking workers. This included the deployment of cameras and parabolic listening devices around picket shacks.\n\nInformation gathered in this eavesdropping operation was used to illegally fire nine workers, who had to wait two years before they were exonerated.\n\nThe strike ended just short of a year later, on July 8th, 2010. Workers won significant raises and a back-to-work bonus, but also received less desirable pension plans. As part of the agreement, Vale received permission to fire 113 employees.\n\nThe strike was the longest such labor action in Canadian history, beating the previous record, set at the same nickel mine (then owned by Inco) in 1978. Workers at Vale again went out on strike in June 2021. One of those strikers, Mark Lambovitch, had participated in the 2009-10 strike, and had this to say:\n\n\"I don't want to do that again, and I'm sure no one does, but we have to stand up for ourselves. Otherwise, we will just keep losing. This company makes billions of dollars, and they just can't give us a fair deal?

In the carnage that followed, ninety-eight protesters and one defender of the Bastille were killed.\n\nGovernor Marquis de Launay, fearing his troops could not hold out, capitulated to the crowd and opened up the Bastille doors. He was captured and dragged towards the H\u00f4tel de Ville in a storm of abuse. While the crowd debated his fate, the badly beaten Launay shouted \"Enough! Let me die!\", kicked a pastry cook in the groin, and was then promptly stabbed to death.\n\nAs news of the successful seizure of the Bastille spread throughout the country, revolutionaries established parallel structures of power for government and militias for civic protection, burned deeds of property, and in some cases attacked wealthy landlords.\n\nKing Louis XVI first learned of the storming the next morning through the Duke of La Rochefoucauld. \"Is it a revolt?\" asked the King.

Likely born into slavery in St. Thomas, Vesey was enslaved by Captain Joseph Vesey in Bermuda.\n\nAt the age of 32, he won a lottery and bought his freedom, but was unable to buy the freedom of his wife and children. In 1818 he co-founded an African Methodist Episcopal (AME) congregation in the city, which enjoyed the support of local white clergy. The church attracted 1,848 members, making it the second-largest AME congregation in the nation.\n\nVesey reportedly began planning the insurrection to take place on Bastille Day, July 14th, 1822, a date notable for its association with the French Revolution, whose victors had abolished slavery in Saint-Domingue.\n\nNews of the plan was said to be spread among thousands of black people throughout Charleston and for tens of miles through plantations along the Carolina coast. Two slaves opposed to Vesey's scheme, George Wilson and Joe LaRoche, gave the first specific testimony about a coming uprising to Charleston officials, saying an uprising was planned for July 14th.\n\nIn June, Vesey was formally accused of being the leader in \"the rising\". He was convicted and quickly executed on July 2nd.\n\nIn the aftermath of Vesey's and others' convictions, authorities blamed \"black religion\" for contributing to the uprising, noting Vesey's role in the AME church.\n\nThe reverend of the church was driven out of the state. Charleston officials ordered the large congregation to be dispersed and the church building to be razed. No black church officially met in Charleston until after the Civil War.",

Although the strike began in Martinsburg, West Virginia, it quickly spread throughout the United States.\n\nStriking workers would not allow any trains, mainly freight, to roll until the third wage cut was revoked. West Virginia Governor Henry M. Mathews sent in National Guard units to restore train service. When the soldiers refused to fire on the workers, he appealed for federal troops.\n\nBecause of economic problems and pressure on wages by the railroads, workers in numerous other states, including New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Illinois, and Missouri, also went out on strike. At its height, the labor action was supported by approximately 100,000 workers nationwide.\n\nThe strike finally ended about 69 days later, forcibly put down by a combination of unofficial militias, the National Guard, and federal troops. An estimated 100 people were killed across the country and more than one hundred million dollars worth of property was damaged, in part from workers destroying the railroad's buildings, engines, and railroad cars.\n\nDue to this unrest and other, later labor efforts, the B&O became the first major employer in the United States to offer a pension plan in 1884.",

Like his father, he joined the socialist Uni\u00f3n General de Trabajadores (UGT).\n\nHe later took an active part in a 1917 strike that was brutally repressed by the Spanish Army. Seventy people were killed, five hundred were injured, and at least 2,000 of the strikers were imprisoned without trial or legal process. Although Durruti managed to escape to France, the violence of state repression left a strong impression on a young Durruti.\n\nWith Juan Garc\u00eda Oliver, Francisco Ascaso, Miguel Garcia Vivancos, Alfonso Miguel, Ricardo Sanz, and Aurelio Hernandez, he founded Los Solidarios (\"The Solidarity\"), a notable \"grupo de afinidad\" implicated in the assassination of Cardinal Juan Soldevilla y Romero.\n\nWorking with the CNT-FAI, Durruti helped coordinate armed resistance to the military rising of the Nationalist faction during the Spanish Civil War, an effort which was to prove vital in preventing General Goded's attempt to seize control of Barcelona. On July 24th, 1936 Durruti led over 3,000 armed anarchists (later known as the Durruti Column) from Barcelona to Zaragoza.\n\nHe was mortally shot under disputed circumstances on November 19th, dying the next day. A few hours after Durruti's death, CNT-FAI troops massacred 52 policemen, who had been held captive in a monastery in Calle de Santa Engracia, in reprisal.\n\n\"It is we who built these palaces and cities, here in Spain and in America and everywhere. We, the workers. We can build others to take their place. And better ones! We are not in the least afraid of ruins. We are going to inherit the earth. There is not the slightest doubt about that. The bourgeoisie might blast and ruin its own world before it leaves the stage of history. We carry a new world here, in our hearts...That world is growing in this minute.\"\n\n- Buenaventura Durruti",

A few months earlier, Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin gave his \"April Theses\", coming out in support of an armed, proletarian insurrection. By July, rank-and-file Bolsheviks were advocating overthrowing the Provisional Government.\n\nOn the morning of July 16th, after a disastrous offensive on World War I's Eastern Front, armed soldiers and workers marched through the streets of Petrograd, to the Tauride Palace. These demonstrators marched under the slogan \"All Power to the Soviets\", firing their rifles into the air and commandeering vehicles.\n\nThe following day at Tauride Palace, the crowd demanded to see a government official, and the Soviet Leaders sent out Viktor Chernov, a prominent member of the  Socialist-Revolutionary Party. When he tried to calm the crowd, they seized him instead, with one protester famously shouting, \"Take power, you son of a bitch, when it is handed to you!\" He was released upon the urging on Leon Trotsky.\n\nThe military authorities sent troops against the demonstrators, leading to many arrests and deaths. The government disarmed workers, disbanded revolutionary military units, destroyed the headquarters of the Bolshevik Central Committee were destroyed, and ordered the arrest of Lenin, Trotsky, and other Bolshevik leaders.\n\nLenin was able to flee to Finland, while Trotsky was arrested alongside Anatoly Lunacharsky and Lev Kamenev. Although the Bolshevik Party's power was temporarily limited in the crackdown, they came to power in the October Revolution just a few months later.",

Powell had entered the home of Patrick Lynch, a superintendent of three apartment houses in Yorkville, to confront him after he hosed down black students for allegedly hanging out on his building's stoops.\n\nGilligan, then off-duty, shot Powell while he was leaving Lynch's building. Although Gilligan claims Powell lunged at him with a knife, witnesses did not corroborate this account; some stated he raised his right hand in a defensive gesture before being killed.\n\nImmediately after Powell's killing, a group of student protesters clashed with police securing the crime scene. The second day, the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) joined the protests.\n\nOn July 18th, the protests became an outright rebellion after Powell's funeral, monitored closely by barricaded police. After the funeral ended and most of the press left, the crowd and cops began to fight. Residents took to the rooftops, throwing bricks, bottles, and mortar at the police below. When one officer shouted \"Go home, go home!\" at the crowd, a reply was heard: \"We are home, Baby.\"\n\nThe unrest lasted until July 22nd, and included a mix of moderate factions from the NAACP as well as black nationalists. When prominent civil rights activist Bayard Rustin tried to discourage rioting, the crowd booed and chanted \"Tom, Uncle Tom\". When an NAACP representative addressed the crowd, stating Bedford-Stuyvesant was a \"community of law\" and discouraging rioting, his van was rocked until he lost control of his microphone.\n\nAt the end of the conflict, reports counted one dead rioter, 118 injured, and 465 arrested. In September, Gilligan was cleared of any wrongdoing by a grand jury and charges were dropped.",

Over 250 of the men refused...\" This refusal came to be known as the \"Port Chicago Mutiny\".\n\nFifty men\u200d, known as the \"Port Chicago 50\", \u200cwere convicted of mutiny and sentenced to 15 years of prison and hard labor, as well as a dishonorable discharge. A young Thurgood Marshall undertook a formidable legal campaign, appealing their convictions, and, due to his efforts and popular pressure, the Navy eventually released 47 of the 50 mutineers.\n\nThe incident highlighted racial inequality within the Navy and was one of several incidents that led to it ending its practice of segregation in 1946.",

The ANC Youth League, founded in 1944 by Anton Lembede, brought in a new generation committed to direct action and civil disobedience. In 1946, the ANC had also allied with the South African Communist Party in assisting in the formation of the South African Mine Workers' Union.\n\nThe Suppression of Communism Act was protested; more than 20,000 black, Indian, and coloured South Africans gathered in Durban on May 28th, 1950 to protest the bill (shown).\n\nAlthough the act ostensibly banned \"communism\", the law defined communism so broadly that it could effectively be used against anyone who opposed government policy, apartheid in particular. Defendants prosecuted under the law were frequently convicted of \"statutory communism\", something Justice Frans Rumpff, presiding in a trial of ANC leaders, noted has \"nothing to do with communism as it is commonly known.\"\n\nOne notable example of political suppression using this law was the 1956 \"Treason Trial\" in Johannesburg, in which 156 people, including Nelson Mandela, were arrested and accused of treason.\n\nAlthough all defendants of the Treason Trial were found not guilty, Mandela himself, along with figures such as Walter Sisulu and Govan Mbek, was sentenced to life in prison in the Rivonia Trial of 1963.",

He was the country's first black head of state and the first elected in an election in which South Africans of all races could participate.\n\nWhile working as a clerk for a law firm as a young man, Mandela befriended two communists - Gaur Radebe, a Hlubi member of the ANC and Communist Party, and Nat Bregman, a Jewish communist who became his first white friend. Mandela attended Communist Party meetings and, while impressed that people of all races were able to meet as equals, he did not join the party because its atheism conflicted with his own Christianity, and because he saw the South African struggle as being based in race rather than class.\n\nMandela joined the ANC a few years later, quickly rising through its ranks. Although initially committed to non-violent protest, he co-founded the militant Umkhonto we Sizwe in 1961 and led a sabotage campaign against the apartheid government.\n\nOn August 5th, 1962, Mandela was captured by South African police, informed by the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of his location. In the subsequent legal proceedings, known as the \"Rivonia Trial\", he was sentenced to life in prison.\n\nAmid growing domestic and international pressure, and with fears of a racial civil war, President F. W. de Klerk released him in 1990 and began negotiating a peaceable end to apartheid with him. In 1994, he became the first legitimately elected President of South Africa.\n\nMandela saw national reconciliation as the primary task of his presidency, and hoped to avoid the damage other post-colonial African economies faced by the departure of white elites.\n\nMandela worked to reassure South Africa's white population that they were protected and represented in the so-called \"the Rainbow Nation\" and embraced liberal (rather than communist) reforms, drawing criticism from more his more militant supporters.\n\n\"Resentment is like drinking poison and then hoping it will kill your enemies.\"\n\n- Nelson Mandela",

During the general strike, civilians acquired weapons by raiding state weapons depots.\n\nOn July 24th, the first voluntary militia, known as the Durriti Column, named after libertarian communist Buenaventura Durriti, left Barcelona for the city of Aragon. Other regiments formed, such as the anarchist Iron Column and the CNT-affiliated Red and Black Column.\n\nOver the next three years, revolutionary Republicans began reorganizing society and production on anarchist principles and battled with the Nationalist forces, led by Francisco Franco.\n\nThe Republicans were aided and joined by anti-fascists and socialists from all over the world: George Orwell, a British writer, joined the fight and later authored a memoir based on his experiences; 3,000 American volunteers joined the fight as the Abraham Lincoln Brigade; the Soviet Union provided the largest amount of foreign aid to the Republic, using their position to try and make the revolution more Bolshevik in character.\n\nThe Republicans were defeated in 1939 and Francisco Franco became the fascist ruler of Spain, ruling until his death in 1975. Many Spanish revolutionaries sought political asylum in the United States, producing the paper \"Espana Libre\" to connect the scattered community of Spanish exiles until Franco's death. Others worked to undermine Franco's government from outside the country.\n\n\"Don't you see why I'll continue fighting as long as these social injustices exist?\"\n\n- Buenaventura Durruti",

Striking workers refused to cede control of the trains to the company, and by midnight up to 1,400 strikers had gathered in the Pennsylvania Railroad rail yards, stopping the movement of some 1,500 cars.\n\nBy the morning of the 21st, it had become clear that many of the Pittsburgh police and local militia had sided with the strikers and were refusing to take action against them.\n\nThe Pennsylvania National Guard were sent in to forcibly quell the rebellion, and the protest turned into a riot after troops shot into a crowd of people for ten minutes, killing women and children. Rioters began looting, setting fire to the train cars and the Union Depot (shown). They also exchanged fire with the National Guard soldiers.\n\nIn total, an estimated 53 civilians were killed and 109 were injured. Eight soldiers were killed in the clashes, another fifteen wounded. This was one of many incidents of strikes, labor unrest and violence in cities across the United States as part of the Great Railroad Strike of 1877.",

In 1910, Lyuh parted from Korean tradition by freeing his household's slaves, giving them enough land and money to become self-sufficient.\n\nLike many in the Korean independence movement, Lyuh sought aid from both right and left. In 1920, he joined the Kory\u01d2 Communist Party, later meeting Leon Trotsky and Vladimir Lenin. In 1924, he also joined Sun Yat-sen's Chinese Nationalist Party to facilitate Sino-Korean cooperation.\n\nIn September 1945, Lyuh proclaimed the establishment of the People's Republic of Korea and became its vice-premier. When the United States occupied the Korean Peninsula, it did not recognize the People's Republic of Korea, and in October he was forced to step down under pressure from the U.S. military government.\n\nIn 1946, Lyuh represented the center-left politically as part of an effort to unify right and left-wing independence struggles, however this strategy earned ire from both sides. On July 19th, 1947, Lyuh was assassinated in Seoul by a 19-year-old North Korean refugee who was an active member of a nationalist right-wing organization.\n\nHis pen-name was Mongyang, the Hanja for \"dream\" and \"the sun\".

The National Secretary of the United Stationary Engine Drivers stated \"We will support your union in every possible way; the people on strike are fighting our fight\", and butchers helped fund relief efforts as the strike wore on for months.\n\nThe press was less sympathetic. In a letter to The Irish Times, the IWWU criticized its reporting:\n\n\"We read your paper sometimes pasted up in those Fleet Street windows and we see it full of news about foreign countries and pictures of people no-one ever saw in Dublin...And you had nearly a page of a letter from New York telling how the girls there do their hair. But for all that you only have two lines or so for 1,500 Dublin women on strike and no word at all about the sort of work they had to do.\"\n\nThe strike was won at the end of October.",

The strike eventually grew to including nearly 5,000 postal workers nationwide, becoming the largest strike of U.S. federal employees between 1970 and 1981.\n\nThe previous contract, which set the terms of employment for U.S. postal workers, had just expired at midnight on July 20th. Postal management, the national union leadership, and the Carter Administration, had created a new collective agreement which ignored most rank and file postal workers' concerns.\n\nIn Jersey City, New Jersey, workers at the Bulk and Foreign Mail Center formed the Good Contract Committee (GCC) to organize a set of demands for the new contract that reflected the interests of the working class. These activists launched a newspaper called P.O.W. (Post Office Worker) and distributed 75,000 leaflets at local postal facilities.\n\nThe Bulk Jersey City wildcat strike lasted for four days in an attempt to nullify the tentative national contract agreement. It shut down the NJ plant as well as another bulk center in Richmond, California.\n\nAfter the strike was broken, 125 workers were fired, 130 were temporarily suspended, 2,500 received letters of warning, and leaders of the walkout were blacklisted. The union did not ratify the proposed work contract, and an arbitrated contract settlement was imposed.",

A nearby building, housing the anti-globalization organization Indymedia and lawyers affiliated with the Genoa Social Forum, was also raided.\n\nOn July 21st, just before midnight, Italian cops raided the school, brutally beating and torturing all present. The police officers fabricated evidence of weapons and assault to justify their brutality, planting molotov cocktails and slashing their own bulletproof vests to justify the violence.\n\nBefore officers entered the school, British journalist Mark Covell confronted them outside, attempting to tell them he was a journalist. Several officers responded by beating him into a coma, breaking his hand, damaging his spine, and breaking six of his ribs. The police then used an armored police van to break through the school gates and 150 policemen, wearing crash helmets and carrying truncheons and shields, entered the school compound.\n\nPolice beat and tortured everyone they found. Several people were beaten unconscious, sexually harassed, had hair cut from their head, and thrown down the stairs. At least one person needed surgery to stop a bleed in their brain.\n\nSome arrested were taken back to a temporary detention facility in Bolzaneto. There, they were tortured and forced to praise fascists such as Mussolini and Pinochet in song. One man testified that, after he refused to sign fabricated statements about what happened, police broke three of his ribs.\n\nAlthough fifteen Italian police officers and doctors were sentenced to jail for the mistreatment of the detainees at Bolzaneto, none served time in prison due to a statute of limitations on their crimes. The British government supported the Italian government in the violence's aftermath; the spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Blair stated \"The Italian police had a difficult job to do. The prime minister believes that they did that job.\"",

Despite this, the ABA did not re-instate the men and continued their discriminatory practices for several decades afterward.\n\nWilson, who was still a member of the Massachusetts State Bar, would go on to fight racial discrimination in legal arenas for the next several decades.

The Long, Hot Summer of 1967 refers to just a few short months in which more than a hundred riots took place across the United States.\n\nIn the early hours of July 23rd, Detroit Police Department (DPD) officers raided an unlicensed weekend drinking club in the office of the United Community League for Civic Action. Expecting a few revelers inside, they instead found a party of 82 people celebrating the return of two local GIs from the Vietnam War. The police decided to arrest everyone present.\n\nAfter the DPD left, a crowd of onlookers began looting an adjacent clothing store. Shortly thereafter, full-scale looting began throughout the neighborhood. This looting escalated into a city-wide uprising that involved shootouts between rioters and police officers.\n\nThe violence escalated throughout the next day, resulting in some 483 fires and 1,800 arrests. Thousands of guns were stolen from stores. Firefighters attempting to put out fires were shot at, police brutality was rampant. Even when thousands of federal troops were sent to occupy Detroit, the rioting could not be quelled until July 28th.\n\n43 people were killed in total, most of whom were black. Among the dead was a four year old girl named Tanya Blanding, shot and killed by Sgt. Mortimer J. LeBlanc after he fired indiscriminately into her mother's apartment. LeBlanc was exonerated of any wrongdoing.\n\nThe scale of the riot was the worst in the United States since the 1863 New York City draft riots during the American Civil War and was not surpassed until the 1992 Los Angeles riots 25 years later.",

As a young man, he sympathized with the 1848 revolutions throughout Europe.\n\nFrom 1851 to 1853, he taught Russian language and literature at the Saratov Gymnasium and openly expressed his beliefs to students, some of whom later became revolutionaries.\n\nIn 1862, he was arrested and confined in the Fortress of St. Peter and Paul, where he wrote his widely influential novel \"What Is to Be Done?\" The novel was an inspiration to many later Russian revolutionaries, who sought to emulate the novel's hero Rakhmetov, who was wholly dedicated to the revolution, ascetic in his habits and ruthlessly disciplined.\n\nNotably, Fyodor Dostoyevsky was so bothered by the political and psychological ideas expressed in the book that he wrote his \"Notes from Underground\" as a critical reaction against them.\n\nChernyshevsky was a dominant intellectual figure of the 1860s revolutionary democratic movement in Russia, despite spending much of his later life in exile to Siberia, and was later highly praised by figures such as Karl Marx, Georgi Plekhanov, and Vladimir Lenin.\n\n\"But does it really help if a person doesn't realize what he lacks, or, if he does, he insists that he doesn't need it at all? That's an illusion, a fantasy. Human nature is stifled by reason, circumstances, and pride. It keeps silent and doesn't make itself known to one's consciousness, all the while silently doing its work of undermining life.\"\n\n- Nikolay Chernyshevsky",

In 1883, her father discovered Lucifer, an anarchist/free love journal published by the feminist Moses Harman. This influence coupled with the Haymarket Riot of 1886 politically radicalized Austin, bringing her to call herself an anarchist and a feminist.\n\nAustin joined the American Press Writers Association, and her work increased as she came in contact with many well known radical writers and lecturers of her time, keeping her busy reading and writing. She contributed to the magazine Lucifer, as well as The Firebrand, Free Society, Discontent, and The Demonstrator.\n\n\"As for intelligence, my sex has already experimented with that ingredient, and found it like mother Eve's forbidden fruit: Very Good.\"\n\n- Kate Austin",

Lasting from 1932 until 1972, all of its participants were poor, rural black men with very limited access to health information.\n\nIn November 1966, Buxtun had filed an official protest on ethical grounds with the PHS's \"Division of Venereal Diseases\" and another protest in November 1968, however his concerns were dismissed both times. In 1968, black statistician and PHS employee William Carter Jenkins also called for an end to the study in his magazine The Drum.\n\nIt wasn't until Buxtun leaked the story to the Washington Star that the study became public knowledge and a national scandal. In 1974, as part of the settlement of a class action lawsuit filed by the NAACP on behalf of study participants and their descendants, the U.S. government paid $10 million ($51.8 million in 2019) and agreed to provide free medical treatment to surviving participants and surviving family members infected as a consequence of the study.\n\nThe Tuskegee Experiments were not the only syphilis experiments performed by the U.S. government against non-white people - from 1946 to 1948, the U.S. conducted a similar study in Guatemala in which doctors infected soldiers, prostitutes, prisoners and mental patients with syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases, without the informed consent of the subjects, leading to at least 83 deaths.\n\nThe experiments were led by physician John Charles Cutler, who also participated in the late stages of the Tuskegee syphilis experiment. Cutler never faced criminal charges for his actions.",

Several years later, they succeeded, finally ousting Batista on December 31st, 1958, replacing his government with a revolutionary socialist state.\n\nThe Cuban Revolution had powerful domestic and international repercussions. In particular, it made Cuba's relationship with the United States significantly more antagonistic.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the revolution, Castro's government began a program of nationalization, transforming Cuba's economy and civil society. Castro's Cuban government was also keen on international aid, providing more medical personnel to the developing world than all the G8 countries combined.\n\nToday is celebrated in Cuba as the Day of the Revolution (Dia de la Revoluci\u00f3n).

The Communist International immediately reinforced its activity sending to Spain its leader Georgi Dimitrov, as well as Palmiro Togliti, the chief of the Communist Party of Italy.\n\nFrom August onward, aid was sent from Russia: more than one ship a day arrived at Spain's Mediterranean ports carrying munitions, rifles, machine guns, hand grenades, artillery, trucks, and Soviet agents and technicians.\n\nThe conference led to the formation of international brigades of volunteer forces, including the American Lincoln Battalion (shown). Similar groups included the George Washington Battalion and the John Brown Battery (both American), while Latin American and Irish troops formed the Centuria Guttieras and the Connolly Column, respectively.\n\nAlthough the politics of the Lincoln Battalion skewed to the left, the one unifying trait of those who joined was a hatred for fascism. They were also inexperienced and not well trained, suffering heavy casualties during the war.\n\nAmerican Canute Frankson explained his decision to join in a letter written on July 6th, 1937:\n\n\"I'm sure that by this time you are still waiting for a detailed explanation of what has this international struggle to do with my being here. Since this is a war between whites who for centuries have held us in slavery, and have heaped every kind of insult and abuse upon us, segregated and Jim-Crowed us; why I, a Negro who have fought through these years for the rights of my people, am here in Spain today?\n\n...Because if we crush Fascism here we'll save our people in America, and in other parts of the world from the vicious persecution, wholesale imprisonment, and slaughter which the Jewish people suffered and are suffering under Hitler's Fascist heels.\n\n...We will build us a new society - a society of peace and plenty.

Armas cracked down on unions and peasant organizations, arresting and killing thousands, often justifying the repression in the name of anti-communism.\n\nOn July 26th, 1957, Armas was assassinated by Romeo V\u00e1squez S\u00e1nchez, a member of the presidential guard. After killing Armas, S\u00e1nchez fled into a different room and committed suicide.\n\nFollowing Armas's death, a period of violent political instability followed, with the U.S. backing state forces while leftist insurgents waged guerilla warfare against the state during the Guatemalan Civil War (1960 - 1996).\n\nThe Civil War killed more than 200,000 civilians. Though crimes against civilians were committed by both sides, 93% of these atrocities were committed by the U.S.-backed military, including a genocidal scorched-earth campaign against the indigenous Maya population during the 1980s. Historians have attributed the violence of the civil war to the 1954 coup, and the \"anti-communist paranoia\" that it generated.",

When the Bolsheviks consolidated power following the Russian Civil War, Lenin and other Bolshevik leaders instituted a ban on factions in the party during the 10th Party Congress of 1921.\n\nThe concept was widely influential in other communist movements; for example, it was adopted in Article 3 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China.\n\nLiberation socialists have been critical of the practice, with anarchist writer Scott Nappolas calling democratic centralism \"the organizational theory of a rising ruling class\".",

Despite the violence, conditions at the prison were not sufficiently improved to prevent more riots - another riot occurred at the Oklahoma State Prison in December 1985.",

        "description": "On this day in 1918, Canadian socialist and labor activist Albert \"Ginger\" Goodwin was murdered by police while avoiding his draft into World War I by hiding out in the hills of Cumberland, British Columbia.\n\nBorn in Yorkshire, England on May 10th, 1887, Goodwin immigrated to Canada in 1909, at the age of 19, working as a coal miner in Nova Scotia.\n\nIn Canada, he organized with the Socialist Party of Canada and became a notable labor leader during the 1912\u20131914 Coal Miner's Strike against Canadian Collieries. Following the strike, he was blacklisted and was forced to move away from Cumberland to find work.\n\nIn 1916, he joined the Mining and Smelter workers Union and was elected as Secretary for the Trail chapter. Following his involvement with trade unions, Goodwin entered politics running as a candidate for the Socialist Party of Canada in the 1916 British Columbian election, although he did not win.\n\nAs World War I broke out, Goodwin became an outspoken advocate against the draft, initially refusing to sign up. Eventually, he was compelled to be drafted, and, after exhausting multiple appeals against his conscription, he fled into the hills of Cumberland, British Columbia.\n\nOn July 27th (some sources say July 26th), Goodwin was shot and killed by a member of the Dominion Police, who had ventured into the hills surrounding Comox Lake to locate men evading the draft and arrest them for their evasion. The officer who killed Goodwin successfully claimed self-defense in court, although it is unknown how the two actually encountered each other.\n\nIn protest to his murder, the first general strike in Canada, the Vancouver General Strike, took place on August 2nd, 1918. In 2015, a film about his life titled \"Goodwin's Way\" was released.\n\n\"War is simply part of the process of Capitalism. Big financial interests are playing the game. They'll reap the victory, no matter how the war ends.\"\n\n- Albert Goodwin",

        "description": "On this day in 1816, American forces, along with their Creek allies, destroyed the \"Negro Fort\", an abandoned British military fort manned by free black men, fugitive slaves, and Seminole warriors, killing hundreds.\n\nWhen withdrawing at the end of the War of 1812, the British Commander Edward Nicolls intentionally left the fully-armed fort in the hands of troops that were largely free black men and fugitive slaves. Also at the Fort were Creek and Choctaw allies who had served alongside the British during the war.\n\nAs Nicolls hoped, the fort, near the Southern border of the United States, became a center and symbol of resistance to American slavery. The \"Negro Fort\" was the largest instance before the American Civil War in which fugitive slaves took up arms against the U.S. government that sought to enslave them.\n\nOn July 27th, American forces acting on orders from General Andrew Jackson committed to an all-out attack against the fort. From a boat on the river, the American forces used red-hot shot, trying to start a fire. A shot landed in the powder magazine, which ignited, blowing up the fort and killing over 270 people instantly.\n\nCaptured black survivors were re-enslaved in Georgia. The largest group of survivors took refuge further south, in Angola, Florida. Others founded Nicholls Town in the Bahamas.\n\nSecretary of State John Quincy Adams later justified the attack and subsequent seizure of Spanish Florida by Andrew Jackson as national \"self-defense\". Seminole anger at the U.S. for the fort's destruction contributed to the breakout of the First Seminole War a year later.",

Approximately 10,000 veterans, women and children lived in the shelters that they built from materials dragged out of a junk pile nearby, which included old lumber, packing boxes, and scrap tin covered with roofs of thatched straw.\n\nOn this day in 1932, President Hoover ordered the Secretary of War to disperse the protesters. After the veterans returned after being pushed out the first time, police fired on the veterans, killing two of them. Federal troops were called in and, armed with bayonets and tear gas, forcefully evicted the Bonus Army.\n\nIn the mayhem that followed, 55 veterans were injured, 135 were arrested, and one three month old baby died. The incident was politically disastrous for President Hoover, who lost the election that year to Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\n\nIn 1933, another Bonus Army marched on Washington D.C., but FDR, perhaps learning from his predecessor's mistakes, created a camp for the soldiers and fed them. He offered the veterans jobs with the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), and those who chose not to work for the CCC were given transportation home.",

Six weeks later, the Wades' new house was dynamited one evening while they were out.\n\nAfter a sensationalized trial, her husband Carl Braden - the perceived ringleader - was convicted of sedition and sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment, although the Supreme Court ruled the laws on which he was convicted unconstitutional and he was freed after eight months.\n\nLater in life, Anne Braden joined Jesse Jackson's \"Rainbow/PUSH Coalition\" and continued her social activism.

Burns was a prodigious student who studied at the universities of Yale and Columbia in the United States, Oxford in the United Kingdom, and Bonn and Berlin in Germany.\n\nBurns became involved in suffragette activism while traveling in Britain, becoming employed by and organizing with the Women's Social and Political Union.\n\nWorking with her friend Alice Paul, Burns engaged in multiple acts of rebellion while in Britain, getting arrested and force-fed when attempting to hunger strike. When Burns refused to open her mouth, the feeding tube was inserted up her nostril, causing severe nosebleeds.\n\nOne incident involving Burns and Paul that led to such treatment was crashing the London Lord Mayor's Ball, mingling with guests before approaching Winston Churchill with a hidden banner shouting \"How can you dine here while women are starving in prison?\"\n\nBurns and other suffrage activists in the U.S. successfully got Congress to vote on a women's suffrage amendment in 1918, however it narrowly failed in the Senate. It was later passed and officially ratified on August 18th, 1920.\n\nAfter achieving this goal, Burns stated \"I don't want to do anything more.

        "description": "On this day in 1983, workers of the copper-producing Phelps Dodge Corporation in Arizona went on strike, beginning a bitter strike that lasted three years, defeated in the biggest mass de-certification of unions in U.S. history.\n\nThe Arizona Copper Mine Strike of 1983 took place in the context of a global drop in copper prices, and began after negotiations between Phelps Dodge and their workers fell through.\n\nThe labor action lasted nearly three years and was a major turning point in U.S. labor history - Phelps Dodge managed to keep copper production going during the strike, most of the striking workers were permanently replaced, and 35 locals of 13 different unions representing Phelps Dodge workers were decertified in Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, the largest mass de-certification in U.S. history.\n\nAlthough there had been no fatalities during the strike, various acts and threats of violence increased the political pressure on Democratic Governor Bruce Babbitt to intervene. Despite having stated \"Phelps Dodge has the worst record in labor relations of any company that has ever operated in Arizona\", Babbitt sent 750 National Guard and state police officers to the area to protect business operations.\n\nAfter a crowd of 1,000 armed protesters shut down the copper plant on threat of violence, ten strikers were arrested in Ajo and charged with rioting, further weakening the strike. The strike officially ended on February 19th, 1986, when the National Labor Relations Board rejected appeals from the unions attempting to halt decertification.",

Roosevelt, with Butler selected to lead a march of veterans to become dictator.\n\nAlthough the accused individuals denied the existence of a plot, a final report by a special House of Representatives Committee confirmed some of Butler's testimony.\n\nToday, Butler is most remembered for his book \"War is a Racket\" and associated anti-imperialist speeches in which he vehemently condemned U.S. military actions. Of his service, he wrote the following:\n\n\"I spent thirty-three years and four months in active military service as a member of this country's most agile military force, the Marine Corps...And during that period, I spent most of my time being a high class muscle-man for Big Business, for Wall Street and for the Bankers.

As a delegation of 130 black New Orleans residents marched behind the U.S. flag toward the Mechanics Institute, Mayor John T. Monroe (who had supported the Confederacy) organized and led a mob of ex-Confederates, white supremacists, and members of the New Orleans Police Force to the Institute to block their way.\n\nOnce the marchers reached the Institute, the police and white mob members attacked them, beating some of the marchers while others rushed inside the building for safety. As the firing continued, some delegates attempted to flee or surrender.\n\nSome of those who surrendered, mostly black people, were killed on the spot. Those who ran were chased, and the killing spread over several blocks around the Institute. Altogether, 238 people were killed and 46 were wounded, including 200 black Union veterans.",

After the Matumbi tribesmen attacked Samanga, Kinjikitile was arrested. Before being executed, he stated that he had already spread the \"medicine of rebellion\" throughout the region.\n\nThe resulting war lasted two years, with the Germans successfully putting the rebellion down by force. As a means to weaken the rebellion, German soldiers deliberately orchestrated a famine by destroying available food sources, devastating the region and killing hundreds of thousands of people.\n\nSuch was the scale of this destruction that, in 1953, journalist John Gunther noted \"even today the Southern Province of Tanganyika, the 'Cinderella Province,' has not fully recovered from the German terror half a century ago. The economy of the region has never been successfully rebuilt\".\n\nAlthough Tanzania demanded reparations from Germany for these atrocities in 2017, the German government has not paid them as of July 2021.",

The shootout occurred when Hatfield and Albert Felts tried to arrest each other, which culminated in Hatfield killing Felts.\n\nHatfield was later assassinated by Baldwin-Felts agents while standing trial for murder, which increased the tensions between coal miners and company owners. Although Hatfield was unarmed when he was gunned down by the agents, his assassins successfully avoided any conviction for their crime on the basis of self-defense.",

The revolution was crushed by overwhelming military force, and Turkish forces slaughtered the civilian population. Anarchist historian Georgi Khadziev wrote that 201 villages and 12,400 houses were burned, 4,694 people killed, and approximately 30,000 refugees fled to Bulgaria.\n\nThe survivors waged a guerrilla campaign for a few years, but the greater effect of the rebellion was the creation of the M\u00fcrzsteg reforms, which provided for foreign policing of the Macedonia region, financial compensation for victims of the violence, and establishment of ethnic boundaries in the region. These reforms, however, did little to solve the crisis, and the Empire lost nearly all of its European territory in the Balkan Wars of 1912-13.\n\nToday, August 2nd is a national holiday in North Macedonia, known as \"Day of the Republic\". There are towns named after the rebellion's leaders in both Bulgaria and North Macedonia. \n\nWhen the uprising began, IMRO issued a statement on its revolutionary aims. Here is a short excerpt:\n\n\"We are taking up arms against tyranny and inhumanity; we are fighting for freedom and humanity; our cause is thus higher than any national or ethnic differences. Therefore we express our solidarity with all others who suffer in the Sultan's dark Empire.\n\nToday it is not only the whole Christian population which suffers, but ordinary Turkish villagers as well. Our only enemies are the Turkish authorities, those who use arms against us, betray us, or who carry out acts of retaliation against helpless old people, women and children rather than against us, the rebels. We will fight these enemies and avenge all wrongs!\"",

Buckley at Cambridge University on the motion of \"Has the American Dream been achieved at the expense of the American Negro?\", stating \"I am stating this very seriously, and this is not an overstatement, I picked the cotton, and I carried it to market, and I built the railroads, under someone else\u2019s whip, for nothing.

The Maddox initiated the incident by opening fire, shooting off three \"warning\" shots; the North Vietnamese boats replied with torpedoes and machine gun fire.\n\nThe exchange caused ten North Vietnamese casualties and damaged one U.S. helicopter; there were no American casualties.\n\nIn response, the U.S. Congress passed a \"Gulf of Tonkin Resolution\", which granted U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson the authority to assist any Southeast Asian country whose government was considered to be jeopardized by \"communist aggression\". The resolution served as Johnson's legal justification for deploying U.S. conventional forces and the commencement of open warfare against North Vietnam.\n\nOn television, President Johnson made misleading statements about the incident and portrayed U.S. military escalation as an act of defense. Since then, the Pentagon Papers, the memoirs of Robert McNamara, and NSA publications from 2005, have proven that the U.S. government lied about the nature of the incident to justify a war against Vietnam.",

Wolin also taught at the University of California, Berkeley, University of California, Santa Cruz, Oberlin College, Oxford University, Cornell University, and University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nWolin's political thought is particularly concerned with the fate of democracy at the hands of bureaucratic imperatives, elitism, and managerial principles and practices. His concepts of \"inverted totalitarianism\" and \"fugitive democracy\" are a particularly important legacy of his work.\n\n\"Mussolini, Stalin, and Hitler did not just invent their personae; they literally built the organizations of their respective dictatorships. Each system was inseparable from its F\u00fchrer, or Duce. Inverted totalitarianism follows an entirely different course: the leader is not the architect of the system but its product.\"\n\n- Sheldon Wolin",

Five years later, when surrounded by Spanish troops, he shot himself under the chin with a .45 caliber pistol to not give them the satisfaction of capturing him. Although the bullet went out of his forehead and knocked him unconscious, he survived; the wound left a great scar and gave him headaches for the rest of his life.\n\nGarc\u00eda played a key role in the ultimately successful War of 1895 and protested the subsequent lack of Cuban autonomy in the conclusion of the war (no Cuban was allowed to sign the terms of surrender and the Spanish leaders in Cuba were allowed to keep their posts in Santiago).\n\nHe died of pneumonia on December 11th, 1898, while on a diplomatic mission in Washington, D.C. Today, his portrait is on the 50 Cuban peso banknote.",

The protest was the first major uprising in Cuba following the Cuban Revolution of 1959, which had brought Fidel Castro and the communist movement into power.\n\nThe uprising took place in a time of extended economic crisis known as the \"special period\", characterized by shortages of petroleum derived prices, rations on food, decreased use of automobiles, and, by necessity, organic innovations to agricultural practice.\n\nOn August 5th, 1994, riots broke out on the Malec\u00f3n, an 8km roadway and seawall that runs along the coast in Havana. Rioters looted stores, chanted political slogans, and damaged hotels. One group unsuccessfully attempted to hijack a boat.\n\nIn the middle of the afternoon, Fidel Castro arrived at the scene, by which time 370 arrests had taken place and around 30 people were injured, 11 of them policemen.\n\nA week later, on August 11th, Castro gave the order for border guards to not suppress illegal exits of the country; an estimated 33,000 people fled, leading to the 1994 Cuban Rafter Crisis.\n\nMany of these exiles successfully sought refuge in the United States, with then President Bill Clinton adopting the \"Wet feet, dry feet policy\", effectively allowing any Cuban who made it to U.S. land to stay, while Cubans intercepted in U.S. waters would be either returned to Cuba or deported elsewhere.",

Cone supervised over 40 black doctoral students while teaching there.\n\n\"Until we can see the cross and the lynching tree together, until we can identify Christ with a 'recrucified' black body hanging from a lynching tree, there can be no genuine understanding of Christian identity in America, and no deliverance from the brutal legacy of slavery and white supremacy.\"\n\n- James Cone",

The park had previously been used as a spot for rallies in protest of this policy.\n\nOn August 6th, 1988, activists attempted to hold another rally in the park and were met by a strong police presence. Protesters held banners proclaiming \"Gentrification is Class War\" (shown).\n\nAlthough police accused protesters of throwing bricks and bottles at police, eyewitnesses agreed that the cops initiated the violence by charging the crowd. Police indiscriminately attacked and harassed all present, including the activists, reporters, and bystanders. One reporter, a black woman, was called a racial slur and attacked, the aftermath of which was caught on film.\n\nIn total, 38 were injured, including several police officers, and 9 were arrested. More than 100 formal complaints about police brutality were filed. When questioned about it, Captain McNamara, a commander at the scene, said \"Obviously tempers flared. But all these allegations will be investigated.\" No cops were charged with any crime related to the event.\n\nThe Tompkins Square Park Riot figured prominently in the local arts community. Poet Allen Ginsburg was an eyewitness to the police riot, and various artists have alluded to it in their work, including Lou Reed, the industrial anarchist band Missing Foundation, and Jonathan Larson, in his musical \"Rent\".\n\nOn November 7th, 2004, about 1,000 people gathered in Tompkins Square Park to attend a concert held there in a yearly ritual commemorating the 1988 riot. According to the NYPD, when officers attempted an arrest for an open container of alcohol, concertgoers \"surrounded and assaulted\" the officers.

Their mouths were mere swollen, pus-covered wounds, which they could not bear to stretch enough to admit the spout of the teapot.\"\n\nDr. Michihiko Hachiya, a survivor, spoke of \"streetcars were standing and inside were dozens of bodies, blackened beyond recognition. I saw fire reservoirs filled to the brim with dead bodies who looked as they had been boiled alive\".\n\nPresident Harry Truman made the case to the public that the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as a necessary and humanitarian means of forcing Japan's surrender. This view was not held, however, by military commanders or leftist American dissidents.\n\nAmong the first Americans to denounce the bombing were Trotskyists such as James P. Cannon, who publicly called it \"an unspeakable atrocity\". The dissent of military commanders was not public, however. In 1950, Admiral William Leahy, Truman's chief of staff, wrote: \"The use of this barbarous weapon at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was of no material assistance in our war against Japan\".\n\nIn his memoirs, President Eisenhower, then General of the Army, confessed that \"dropping the bomb was completely unnecessary\".",

She joined the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) in 1936 and late in life, in 1961, became its chairwoman.\n\nFlynn was also a founding member of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), but was expelled in 1940 during an institution-wide purge of all communists from ACLU leadership. This decision was reversed twelve years after her death, in 1976.\n\nIn 1948, she was arrested, along with eleven other prominent members of the Communist Party, for violating the Smith Act. She served two years in prison, and continued her political activism after her release.\n\nFlynn died during a visit to the Soviet Union, where she was accorded a state funeral with processions in the Red Square attended by over 25,000 people.\n\n\"I fell in love with my country - its rivers, prairies, forests, mountains, cities and people.

        "description": "On this day in 1865, freedman Jourdon Anderson (1825 - 1907) wrote a humorous and pointed response to decline the request of his former master to return to the plantation, which had fallen into disrepair after the Civil War.\n\nThe letter's dry wit has been compared to the style of Mark Twain, and it became an immediate sensation, becoming published in the press a few weeks later.\n\nJourdon had been enslaved since he was a child in Wilson County, Tennessee, working the plantation of the Anderson family. In 1864, Union Army soldiers camped on the Anderson plantation and freed him. Subsequently, he moved to Dayton, Ohio with his family, finding work as a sexton with the Wesleyan Methodist Church.\n\nIn 1865, he received a letter from Colonel P.H. Anderson, his former master, who requested that Jourdon return to the plantation in a last-ditch to save the farm, which had fallen into disrepair after the Civil War.\n\nOn August 7th, 1865, Jourdon dictated his response. Here are some excerpts (the letter in full is linked below):\n\n\"I got your letter, and was glad to find that you had not forgotten Jourdon, and that you wanted me to come back and live with you again, promising to do better for me than anybody else can. I have often felt uneasy about you. I thought the Yankees would have hung you long before this, for harboring Rebs they found at your house.\n\n...[My wife and I] have concluded to test your sincerity by asking you to send us our wages for the time we served you...I served you faithfully for thirty-two years, and Mandy twenty years. At twenty-five dollars a month for me, and two dollars a week for Mandy, our earnings would amount to eleven thousand six hundred and eighty dollars.\n\nAdd to this the interest for the time our wages have been kept back, and deduct what you paid for our clothing, and three doctor's visits to me, and pulling a tooth for Mandy, and the balance will show what we are in justice entitled to. Please send the money by Adams's Express, in care of V. Winters, Esq., Dayton, Ohio. If you fail to pay us for faithful labors in the past, we can have little faith in your promises in the future.\n\n...P.S.\u2014Say howdy to George Carter, and thank him for taking the pistol from you when you were shooting at me.\"\n\nJourdon's offer was declined, and he continued to live in Dayton, dying there at the age of 81 in 1907. Colonel Anderson, having failed to attract his former slaves back, sold the land for a pittance to try to get out of debt, dying two years later.\n\nPrior to 2006, historian Raymond Winbush tracked down the living relatives of the Colonel Anderson, reporting that they \"are still angry at Jordan for not coming back\", knowing that the plantation was in serious disrepair after the war.",

Over the following days, the mass demonstrations devolved into violent riots as the military fired into crowds of protesters.\n\nThe 8888 Uprising, also known as the People Power Uprising, took place in the context of an economic crisis in the country, governed as a one-party state by the Burma Socialist Programme Party, led by General Ne Win. Students and farmers had been engaging in protest and campaigns of rebellion against various state economic policies since 1985.\n\nOn August 8th, 1988 (thus the uprising's name) mass anti-government demonstrations took place throughout the country. Participants came from a wide variety of demographics - Buddhists, Christians, Muslims, students, workers, young and old participated.\n\nThe protests began relatively peacefully, with only casualty reported on the first day, the result of a frightened traffic cop who fired into the crowd and fled. Over the next few days, the protests devolved into violent riots as the military and police fired on the protesters, at one point even shooting doctors and nurses tending to the wounded.\n\nProtesters responded by throwing Molotov cocktails, swords, knives, rocks, and poisoned darts and bicycle spokes. In one incident, rioters burned a police station and killed four fleeing police officers.\n\nOn August 26th, Aung San Suu Kyi, the daughter of anti-imperialist revolutionary Aung San, addressed half a million people at Shwedagon Pagoda, becoming an international figure in the uprising, supported by the West. Her party would later go on to win elections in 1990, however these results were ignored by the military government and she was arrested.\n\nOn September 18th, the military retook power in the country, with General Saw Maung repealing the 1974 constitution and imposing martial law. The demonstrations were violently suppressed and, by the end of September, at least 3,000 people were killed, however estimates of casualties vary widely.\n\nMany of the student leaders of the uprising became lifelong activists, also playing a role in the 2007 Saffron Revolution nineteen years later.",

When revolution broke out in 1910, he was positioned as a central leader of the peasant revolt in Morelos. Zapata was responsible for defeating and ousting various invading armies from Morelos on multiple occasions.\n\nOn April 10th, 1919, Zapata was assassinated, double-crossed by a member of the Mexican Army who had pretended to switch sides.

While in jail, he read \"The Seven Story Mountain\" by Thomas Merton, and became politically radicalized, reading the works of MLK Jr., Malcolm X, and the Black Panther Party (BPP).\n\nAfter his release, Jim\u00e9nez transformed the Young Lords from a street gang into a human rights organization, entering into the \"Rainbow Coalition\" with Fred Hampton, head of the BPP's Chicago chapter.

Under Kotane's leadership, the SACP, together with the ANC, organized various anti-apartheid demonstrations and labor strikes, and his high profile in both organizations made him a major target of the South African government's political repression.\n\nIn 1963, he left South Africa to lead the SACP in-exile from Tanzania.\n\nHe died in 1978 after suffering a stroke, at the age of 72.

        "description": "On this day in 1965, the Watts Riots began in Los Angeles after police beat Marquette Fry and his family after he was pulled over for drunk driving. The uprising was the largest in city history until the Rodney King riots of 1992, with 34 deaths and $40 million in property damage across a 46 square mile (119 square km) stretch of L.A.\n\nThe uprising took place in the context of a highly racialized city, with severely discriminatory housing, educational, and economic practices. The community of Watts was predominantly black and regularly suffered brutality at the hands of police.\n\nAfter Marquette, along with his brother and mother, were beaten and arrested by police, an angry mob formed and riots broke out. For the next six days, rioters clashed with police and armed National Guardsmen, who had been sent by the thousands to suppress the uprising.\n\nLos Angeles Chief of Police William Parker (incidentally, Parker also coined the phrase \"thin blue line\" around this time), Chief Parker compared the rioters to the Viet Cong, promising a \"paramilitary\" response to the disorder. One officer later stated \"The streets of Watts resembled an all-out war zone in some far-off foreign country, it bore no resemblance to the United States of America.\"\n\nBetween 31,000 and 35,000 people participated in the riots, while 70,000 people were \"sympathetic, but not active\". Over the six days of rioting, there were 34 deaths (23 of which were the result of police shootings), 1,032 injuries, 3,438 arrests, and over $40 million in property damage.\n\nFollowing the uprising's suppression, a wave of white flight occurred in surrounding areas, leading to significant demographic changes in areas such as Compton and Huntington Park.\n\nA government committee known as the McCone Commission concluded that the cause of the riots was primarily socio-economic, and recommended reforms along these lines. Most of these recommendations were not adopted.\n\n\"The whole point of the outbreak in Watts was that it marked the first major rebellion of Negroes against their own masochism and was carried on with the express purpose of asserting that they would no longer quietly submit to the deprivation of slum life.\"\n\n- Bayard Rustin",

Originally associated with the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), Liebknecht later became a co-founder with Rosa Luxemburg of both the Spartacus League and the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). Liebknecht is also known for his outspoken opposition to World War I.\n\nIn January 1919, the Spartacus League played a leading role in the Spartacist Uprising, a general strike and armed rebellion in Berlin. The uprising was crushed by the SPD government and the Freikorps (paramilitary units composed of World War I veterans). For their role in the uprising, Liebknecht and Luxemburg were both kidnapped, tortured, and murdered on January 15th, 1919.\n\nTheir contributions to European socialism are commemorated annually in Germany during the second weekend of January, an event known as the Liebknecht-Luxemburg Demonstration, or \"LL-Demo\" for short.\n\n\"The main enemy of the German people is in Germany: German imperialism, the German war party, German secret diplomacy. This enemy at home must be fought by the German people in a political struggle, cooperating with the proletariat of other countries whose struggle is against their own imperialists.\"\n\n- Karl Liebknecht",

Instead, they would show up en masse to work and a handful would be selected - the rest would be sent home without payment. In this way, their employers could only pay for exactly the labor needed for the day.\n\nOn August 14th, led by socialist union organizer Ben Tillet, the men in the West India Dock struck immediately and started persuading other dockers to join them. The support they needed came when the Amalgamated Stevedores Union (whose workers were essential the operation of the dock), under Tom McCarthy, joined the strike.\n\nThe labor action became so large (one estimation was 130,000 workers), that it could possibly be considered a general strike. A newspaper reported \"Dockmen, lightermen, bargemen, cement workers, carmen, ironworkers and even factory girls are coming out.\"\n\nThe London Dock Strike resulted in a victory for the 100,000 strikers and established strong trade unions amongst London dockers, one of which became the nationally important \"Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Labourers' Union\". The strike is widely considered a milestone in the development of the British labor movement, symbolizing the growth of industrial unionism, including casual, unskilled and poorly paid workers, in contrast to craft unionism.",

The Marikana Massacre took place on the 25-year anniversary of a nationwide strike by over 300,000 South African workers.\n\nOn August 10th, miners had initiated a wildcat strike at a site owned by Lonmin in the Marikana area, close to Rustenburg, South Africa. Although ten people (mostly workers) had been killed before August 16th, it was on that day that an elite force from the South African Police Service fired into a crowd of strikers with rifles, killing 34 and injuring 76.\n\nAfter surveying the aftermath of the violence, photojournalist Greg Marinovich concluded that \"[it is clear] that heavily armed police hunted down and killed the miners in cold blood.\"\n\nFollowing the massacre, a massive wave of strikes occurred across the South African mining sector - in early October, analysts estimated that approximately 75,000 miners were on strike from various gold and platinum mines and companies across South Africa, most of them doing so illegally.\n\nA year after the Marikana Massacre, author Benjamin Fogel wrote \"Perhaps the most important lesson of Marikana is that the state can gun down dozens of black workers with little or no backlash from 'civil society', the judicial system or from within the institutions that supposedly form the bedrock of democracy.\"",

At the time, only approximately 11% of adult males could vote, very few of them in the industrial north, which was the worst hit by the crises.\n\nReformers, led by figures such as the radical orator Henry Hunt and social reformer Samuel Bamford, identified democratic and parliamentary reforms as a way to mobilize the masses, acquiring three-quarters of a million signatures in 1817, a proposal flatly rejected by the House of Commons.\n\nOn August 16th, 1819, a mass rally of democratic reformers gathered in St. Peter's Field in Manchester. The meeting's aims were explicitly peaceful and legal; organizers stated the protest's purpose was \"to consider the propriety of adopting the most LEGAL and EFFECTUAL means of obtaining a reform in the Common House of Parliament\" and did not allow participants to bear arms.\n\nDespite this, members of the British Cavalry attempted to arrest leaders of the protest. When their horses became stuck in the crowd, officers panicked and began indiscriminately attacking the meeting's participants. Exact numbers are difficult to calculate, but modern estimates are that 18 people were killed and approximately 600 more were injured.\n\nAmong those killed was a two year old boy, knocked from his mother's arms by a charging horse. John Lees, a working class veteran of Waterloo who later died of wounds sustained at the Peterloo Massacre, stated \"At Waterloo there was man to man but there it was downright murder\".\n\nThe British government supported the military's actions, and as a result of the disorder, passed the \"Six Acts\", legislation to suppress radical meetings and publications. By the end of 1820, every significant working-class radical reformer was in jail.\n\nOn the political situation after Peterloo, historian Robert Reid wrote \"it is not fanciful to compare the restricted freedoms of the British worker in the post-Peterloo period in the early nineteenth century with those of the black South African in the post-Sharpeville period of the late twentieth century.\"",

Working in Kingston, he became involved in trade unionism before living briefly in Costa Rica, Panama, and England.\n\nGreatly influenced by Booker T. Washington's autobiography \"Up From Slavery\", Garvey began to support economic separatism and social segregation. In 1914, he founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA-ACL, commonly known as UNIA), through which he declared himself Provisional President of Africa. Ideologically a black nationalist and Pan-Africanist, his ideas came to be known as \"Garveyism\".\n\nGarvey launched various businesses in the U.S., including the Negro Factories Corporation and Negro World newspaper. In 1919, he became President of the Black Star Line shipping and passenger company, designed to forge a link between North America and Africa and facilitate African-American migration to Liberia.\n\nIn 1923, Garvey was convicted of mail fraud for selling the company's stock and imprisoned in the U.S. Penitentiary Atlanta for nearly two years. Garvey blamed Jewish people for his sentence, claiming that they were prejudiced against him because of his links to the Ku Klux Klan, which he had collaborated with on the basis of their shared goal of racial separatism.\n\nWhile Garvey exerted considerable influence on later black power movements such as the Rastafari and Nation of Islam (NOI), his legacy is polarizing for many. While Garvey's critics were highly critical of his collaboration with white supremacists and prejudice against mixed-race people and Jews, while his supporters lauded Garvey for encouraging a sense of pride and self-worth among Africans and the African diaspora amid widespread poverty, discrimination, and colonialism.\n\n\"A people without the knowledge of their past history, origin and culture is like a tree without roots.\"\n\n- Marcus Garvey",

While slaves generally abhorred violence, holding whites hostage in their homes and stockages to make demands, the state declared martial law, killing hundreds of people and displaying their corpses as a warning to the survivors.\n\nThe revolt took place in modern day Guyana, then the British colony of Demerara-Essequibo. The colony's primary export was sugar, and black slaves drastically outnumbered other groups on the island. The year of the uprising, the population consisted of approximately 2,500 whites, 2,500 freed blacks, and 77,000 slaves.\n\nThe rebellion was closely linked to the church of John Smith, a British missionary. One of the primary instigators of the uprising was Jack Gladstone, the son of Quamina, a prominent member of Smith's church.\n\nUpon learning of his son's plans, Quamina opposed the revolt, urging the planners to initiate a strike instead, and to not use violence. Quamina also informed John Smith of the plans, which Smith declined to disclose to the authorities.\n\nOn August 18th, 1823, more than 10,000 slaves rose up against their masters to demand better treatment and more rights as slaves. Slaves generally abhorred violence, choosing instead to hold whites hostage in their homes and stockades as leverage with which to make their demands. Despite the large scale of the revolt, some slaves stayed loyal to their masters and defended their plantations.\n\nThe Governor immediately declared martial law, and, when a crowd of 2,000 slaves refused to disperse on order of a colonial militia, soldiers fired into the crowd, killing hundreds of people. Within two days, the rebellion was suppressed.\n\nIn the weeks following the suppression of uprising, the colonizers executed dozens of slaves, displaying the dismembered heads of those killed as a warning to the rest.\n\nJack Gladstone was deported to was sold and deported to St. Lucia, while Quamina was hunted down and killed on September 23rd. John Smith was arrested for not informing the government of the plans of rebellion and died in prison. His death became a watershed moment in the British abolitionist movement; he was deemed the \"Demerara Martyr\".\n\nUnder pressure from London, the Demerara Court of Policy passed various reforms for slave labor in 1825, institutionalizing working hours and some civil rights for the enslaved. The British government outlawed slavery in all of its territories in 1838.",

When the AIOC refused to co-operate with the Iranian government, the parliament voted to nationalize Iran's oil industry and to expel foreign corporate representatives from the country.\n\nIn response, the British began a worldwide boycott of Iranian oil to pressure Iran economically and engaged in subterfuge to undermine Mosaddegh's government.\n\nJudging Mosaddegh to be unreliable and fearing a communist takeover, Winston Churchill and the Eisenhower administration overthrew Iran's government. The coup action was also supported by the Iranian clergy, who opposed Mosaddegh's secularism.\n\nThe Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) hired mobsters to stage pro-Shah riots and paid others to travel to Tehran and take over the streets of the city. Between 200 and 300 people were killed in the ensuing mayhem.\n\nMosaddegh was arrested, tried, and convicted of treason by the Shah's military court. Many of his supporters were imprisoned and several received the death penalty. Mosaddegh himself lived the rest of his life under house arrest, dying in 1967.\n\nAfter the coup, the Shah ruled as a monarch for the next 26 years until he was overthrown in the Iranian Revolution in 1979.",

One example of this is when, on August 26th, an Italian cruise liner arrived in Zanzibar seeking water supplies, but could not get it due to the dockworkers' strike.\n\nThe labor action did not begin as a general strike. Abbas Othman, an AWC worker and strike leader, had attempted to involve other labor groups, but they initially declined.\n\nAs food shortages began to occur, Zanzibar President Glenday ordered that all weapons were to be delivered to the police station and banned all meetings not approved by the Chief of Police. A few days later, he declared sweeping emergency powers that gave the government control over food and movement of people.\n\nDespite this repression, the general strike succeeded, both in the short term and the long. By December 1st, 1948, the AWC had increased all of their laborers' wage rates. Higher wages and better conditions were also put in place for workers involved in the packing of produce for export, the bakery trade, the soap and oil factories, government, and coconut husking. A Port Labour Advisory Committee was also formed to advise the government of labor conditions for port workers.",

        "description": "On this day in 1976, Devshi Bhudia, employed by Grunwick Film Processing Laboratories, was fired for working too slowly, triggering labor actions that grew into the Grunwick Dispute, a watershed strike in British labor history.\n\nThe Grunwick Dispute was the first black and migrant worker struggle that won broad support from the labor movement, and more than 500 people were arrested, the most since the general strike of 1926.\n\nThe Grunwick firm relied almost exclusively on the labor of immigrant women, who were paid poorly and forced to work long hours. Of the company's 440 employees, 80% were of Asian origin and 10% of Afro-Caribbean origin, and application forms for employment at Grunwick asked for passport numbers and \"date of arrival in the UK.\"\n\n The racist basis for these working conditions was explained by the strikers: \"Imagine how humiliating it was for us, particularly for older women, to be working and to overhear the employer saying to a younger, English girl 'you don't want to come and work here, love, we won't be able to pay the sort of wages that'll keep you here' – while we had to work there because we were trapped.\"\n\nThe strike was sparked by the dismissal of Devshi Bhudia on August 20th, 1976. Three other workers, Chandrakant Patel, Bharat Patel and Suresh Ruparelia, walked out in solidarity.\n\nBy August 23rd, six workers began picketing outside Grunwick offices. Soon, postal workers began to refuse crossing the picket line to deliver mail, and the size of the pickets began to grow as workers from other industries joined the protest in solidarity. In this fashion, the Grunwick Dispute became the first labor struggle where majority non-white strikers received widespread support from the labor movement (similar, previous disputes did not enjoy solidarity from white workers and racist unions).\n\nMeanwhile, Grunwick raised pay by 15% for non-striking workers on the condition that they would not join the union. In June and July of 1977, workers from across London began trying to prevent scabs from showing up to work, leading to violent conflicts with police and widespread media coverage.\n\nThe incumbent Labour government commissioned the \"Scarman Inquiry\", which recommended both union recognition and re-instatement of the workers, but the employer, backed by the right-wing National Association For Freedom (NAFF) and the Conservative Party, successfully rejected these recommendations.\n\nThe Trades Union Congress (TUC) subsequently withdrew their support, and the workers' strike committee announced the end of the dispute in June 1978. The strike's defeat was a major victory for the British right-wing, which began to successfully undermine the power of labor under the leadership of Margaret Thatcher, who became Prime Minister in 1979.\n\nOn the strike, one of its leaders, Jayaben Desai, stated: \"The strike is not so much about pay, it is a strike about human dignity.\"",

Romania and Albania declined to participate in the attack, the latter of which left the Warsaw Pact a month later.\n\nThe invasion took place in the context of liberal reforms promoted by the communist government of Alexander Dub\u010dek, known as the \"Prague Spring\". The reforms included a decentralization of administrative authority, loosening of restrictions on the media, speech and travel, and the decision to split into two countries, the Czech and Slovak Republics.\n\nThe reforms were not received well by the Soviets, who, after failed negotiations, sent ~500,000 Warsaw Pact troops and tanks to occupy the country. 137 civilians were killed and 500 seriously wounded during the occupation.\n\nDub\u010dek and the Chairman of the National Assembly Josef Smrkovsky were arrested and taken to Moscow. They were allowed to return after adopting the \"Moscow Protocol\", which effectively reversed the liberalization of the Prague Spring.\n\nThe occupation was met with widespread, mostly non-violent resistance, which began to decline after a week. The spirit of dissent continued, however - on January 19th, 1969, a student named Jan Palach set himself on fire in Prague to protest the renewed suppression of free speech. On September 8th, 1968, Polish accountant Ryszard Siwiec immolated himself in Warsaw during a harvest festival in protest of the invasion.\n\nThe invasion caused major fractures in communist movements worldwide, both inside and outside the Soviet bloc. Several KGB/GRU defectors and spies such as Oleg Gordievsky, Vasili Mitrokhin, and Dmitri Polyakov have pointed out the 1968 invasion as their motivation for cooperating with the Western Intelligence agencies.\n\nInternationally, the Communist Party of Greece (KKE) suffered a major split over the internal disputes over the Prague Spring, while Albania left the Warsaw Pact following the invasion and the People's Republic of China strongly condemned the military action. Meanwhile, the Portuguese Communist Party, the South African Communist Party, and the Communist Party USA supported the Soviet position.",

He learned how to read and write at a young age and was deeply religious, eventually becoming an influential preacher in the area.\n\nIn early 1831, on the basis of religious visions, Nat Turner began preparing a slave insurrection. The rebellion began on this day in 1831, and rebels traveled from house to house, freeing slaves and killing many of the white people that they encountered.\n\nAt least 55 white people were killed, and the slaves killed men, women, and children. The group spared a few homes \"because Turner believed the poor white inhabitants 'thought no better of themselves than they did of negroes'\".\n\nThe rebellion was put down by a combined force of local militia and three companies of artillery. The state executed 56 black people, and militias killed at least 100 more, some of whom were not involved in the rebellion.\n\nTurner went on the run, eluding capture for six weeks. On October 30th, 1831, a white farmer discovered him hidden among the local Nottoway people in a depression in the earth, created by a large, fallen tree that was covered with fence rails. After being tried and convicted for \"conspiring to rebel and making insurrection\", he was asked if he regretted what he had done. Turner responded \"Was Christ not crucified?\"\n\nHe was hanged on November 11th, 1831. After his death, state legislatures passed new laws prohibiting education of slaves and free black people, restricting rights of assembly and other civil liberties for free black people, and requiring white ministers to be present at all worship services.",

He later became an author, publishing two novels with his own illustrations and publishing a biography of the painter Matth\u0133s Maris.\n\nArondeus was active in the anti-Nazi resistance, helping forge documents to protect persecuted groups. A major obstacle to the success of this forgery was the Municipal Office for Population Registration, an Amsterdam office that contained millions of identifying records for Jews and others wanted by the Gestapo.\n\nArondeus and other members of the resistance bombed the office on March 27th, 1943, subduing the guards via injection, and succeeding in destroying approximately 800,000 documents. Arondeus was arrested on April 1st.\n\nAlthough he refused to give up the rest of his team, his notebook was found and a majority of the group was also arrested. On June 18th, Arondeus and fourteen others were tried and sentenced to death. Ardoneus pleaded guilty and took the full blame, which may have contributed to two members receiving clemency.\n\nBefore his execution, Arondeus made a point of ensuring the public would be aware that he and two other men in the group were gay, asking an acquaintance to \"Tell the people that homosexuals can be brave!\". Sometimes this quote is translated as \"The people would know that gays are no cowards!\" or \"Tell the people that homosexuals are not by definition weak\".",

Expelled from Moscow State University, Bogdanov eventually graduated from the University of Kharkiv as a qualified medical doctor.\n\nAround the same time, Bogdanov became a political prisoner and was arrested by the Tsar's police, spent six months in prison, and exiled to Vologda. In 1903, Bogdanov played a key role in the formation and organization of the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Party.\n\nHe became a political rival of Vladimir Lenin in the following years, in which the Bolsheviks were highly factional. In 1909, Lenin published a scathing book of criticism of Bognadov's ideas (Materialism and Empiriocriticism), accusing him of philosophical idealism. Later that year, Bognadov was defeated in a Paris party conference and expelled from the Bolsheviks.\n\nDespite this, Bognadov wielded political influence in the following years, publishing articles about the Russian and October Revolutions. After the October Revolution, he refused invitations to rejoin the party. In 1923, he was arrested by the GPU (Soviet secret police) for suspicion of involvement in the socialist opposition group \"Workers' Truth\", although he was released without charge.\n\nBognadov contributed to a wide variety of fields, including philosophy, creative writing, political economy, and a precursor to systems theory he called \"tektology\". In 1928, he died suddenly after he taking an experimental blood transfusion from a student suffering from malaria and tuberculosis.",

The Romanian military subsequently arrested all other fascist government officials, and joined in the Soviet Army's advance into Germany.\n\nAntonescu was tried and executed in 1946.

When Corporal Charles Baltimore later asked the officers about the condition of Edwards, he was also pistol-whipped, shot at while fleeing, and then captured and beaten.\n\nWhen rumors of the brutality made it back to Camp Logan, 156 soldiers of the Third Battalion of the all-black Twenty-fourth United States Infantry Regiment mutinied and began rioting, marching into Houston, Texas with arms. Police, thinking the black men couldn't arm themselves, only sent six officers out to meet the group, two of whom were killed immediately.\n\nBy the time the firing ceased, 17 people were dead: four police officers, nine civilians, and two soldiers. The next morning, Houston was placed under martial law. The remaining soldiers in the Twenty-fourth's camp were disarmed, and a house-to-house search uncovered a number of soldiers hiding within the San Felipe district. Soldiers in local jails were turned over to the Army, and the Third Battalion was sent by rail back to New Mexico.\n\nThe soldiers were tried at three courts-martial for mutiny. Nineteen were executed and 41 were sentenced to life imprisonment. In 1991, historian Calvin C. Smith noted that many of the sentenced were not conclusively identified as having even participated in the riot, despite repeated pledges of fair trials and absolute transparency from various political officials, including white supremacist President Woodrow Wilson.",

The labor action was not just a strike, but also included mass pickets, boycotts, and secondary boycotts by the participants.\n\nThe price of lettuce almost doubled immediately, and the interruption to work cost lettuce growers approximately $500,000 a day. The strike was a bitter dispute which suffered violence and state repression. C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez, a leading labor organizer, was jailed after refusing to stop the picketing on court order. On November 4th, 1970 a UFW regional office was bombed.\n\nThe strike ended on March 26th, 1971 when the Teamsters and UFW signed a new jurisdictional agreement reaffirming the UFW's right to organize field workers, however jurisdictional disputes between the UFW and Teamsters continued for years afterward. In 1975, the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act (CALRA) became law, establishing the right to collective bargaining for farmworkers in that state, a first in U.S. history.",

Vanzetti was a fishmonger born on June 11th, 1888. Two men met at a strike in 1917.\n\nAfter a deadly shoe store robbery in 1919, both Sacco and Vanzetti were arrested. When searched by police, both denied owning any guns, but were found to be holding loaded pistols. Sacco was found to have an Italian passport, anarchist literature, and a loaded .32 Colt Model 1903 automatic pistol. Vanzetti had four 12-gauge shotgun shells and a five-shot nickel-plated .38-caliber Harrington & Richardson revolver. Despite this, both Sacco and Vanzetti had solid alibis for where they were during the murder.\n\nAnti-Italian and anti-anarchist sentiments played a significant role in their trial. Presiding Judge Thayer was an avowed enemy of anarchists. When giving his final statement in 1927, Vanzetti said \"I am suffering because I am a radical and indeed I am a radical; I have suffered because I am an Italian and indeed I am an Italian...if you could execute me two times, and if I could be reborn two other times, I would live again to do what I have done already.\"\n\nSacco and Vanzetti's arrest, trial, conviction, and execution became an international incident that caused an outrage among people of all political persuasions, not just anarchists. Among their advocates were Harvard law professor and future Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter, who wrote that Judge Thayer's statement was \"a farrago of misquotations, misrepresentations, suppressions, and mutilations\",\n\nAnarchist supporters of Sacco and Vanzetti orchestrated campaigns on their behalf, both peaceful and non-violent. Bombing campaigns were undertaken, targeting Judge Thayer, Wall Street, and the American Embassy in Buenos Aires.\n\nDespite the advocacy on their behalf, the violence, and pleas for a re-trial, Sacco and Vanzetti's death sentences were not commuted. Vanzetti, in his final moments, shook hands with guards and thanked them for their kind treatment, read a statement proclaiming his innocence, and finally said, \"I wish to forgive some people for what they are now doing to me.\" Sacco was next and walked quietly to the electric chair, then shouted \"Farewell, mother.\"\n\nOn the 50th anniversary of the executions, Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis issued a proclamation that Sacco and Vanzetti had been unfairly tried and convicted and that \"any disgrace should be forever removed from their names\".",

Zinn wrote over 20 books, including his best-selling and influential book \"A People's History of the United States\", which was the inspiration for making this calendar.\n\nIn the 1960s, as a result of Zinn's campaigning against the Vietnam War and his influence on Martin Luther King Jr., the FBI designated him a high security risk to the country by adding him to the Security Index, a list of American citizens who could be summarily arrested if a state of emergency were to be declared. The FBI memos also show that they were concerned with Zinn's repeated criticism of the FBI for failing to protect black people against white mob violence. Zinn's daughter said she was not surprised by the files; \"He always knew they had a file on him.\"\n\nZinn described himself as \"something of an anarchist, something of a socialist. Maybe a democratic socialist.\" He wrote extensively about the Civil Rights Movement, the anti-war movement and labor history of the United States. His memoir, You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train (Beacon Press, 2002), was also the title of a 2004 documentary about Zinn's life and work.

        "description": "John Maclean, born on this day in 1879, was a Scottish schoolteacher and revolutionary socialist, sometimes referred to as \"Scotland's Lenin\".\n\nMaclean's revolutionary politics were well-known, and in 1915, he was arrested under the Defence of the Realm Act and fired from his job as a primary school teacher. As a consequence, he became a full-time Marxist lecturer and organizer, educating other Glaswegian workers in Marxist theory.\n\nMaclean was also noted for his outspoken opposition to World War I, and, in 1918, he was arrested for sedition. During the trial, Maclean gave the now legendary \"speech from the dock\", expounding on his position. He was sentenced to five years' penal servitude, but was released after the November armistice.\n\nMaclean supported Irish independence on an anti-imperialist basis, describing the Irish War of Independence as \"The Irish fight for freedom\" and even condoning the assassination of a magistrate, Alan Bell. He saw the war in Ireland as strengthening the Bolshevik revolution in Russia, arguing that \"Irish Sinn F\u00e9iners, who make no profession of socialism or communism...are doing more to help Russia and the revolution than all we professed Marxian Bolsheviks in Britain\".\n\nIn captivity, Maclean had been on hunger strike, and prolonged force-feeding had permanently affected his health. He collapsed during a speech and died of pneumonia, aged forty-four.\n\n\"I have taken up unconstitutional action at this time because of the abnormal circumstances and because precedent has been given by the British government. I am a socialist, and have been fighting and will fight for an absolute reconstruction of society for the benefit of all. I am proud of my conduct. I have squared my conduct with my intellect, and if everyone had done so this war would not have taken place...\n\n...I appeal exclusively to [the working class] because they and they only can bring about the time when the whole world will be in one brotherhood, on a sound economic foundation. That, and that alone, can be the means of bringing about a re-organisation of society. That can only be obtained when the people of the world get the world, and retain the world.\" - John MacLean, from the \"Dock Speech\"",

Up to 100 people were killed and nearly one thousand miners were arrested on multiple charges, including murder and treason.\n\nFor five days, from late August to early September 1921, some 10,000 armed coal miners confronted 3,000 lawmen and strikebreakers who were backed by coal mine operators during the miners' attempt to unionize the southwestern West Virginia coalfields. The battle ended after approximately one million rounds were fired, aerial bombardment of the miners, and the United States Army's arrival, intervening on orders from the president.",

More than half of the CTA's bus drivers were African-American and for weeks they had been fighting what they considered unfair union representation.\n\nLike many other protest movements in the 50s and 60s, the drivers took as their model the Montgomery bus boycott, organizing car pools and CTW \"courtesy cars\" to meet the transportation shortfall in some neighborhoods. According to Standish Willis, one of the striking drivers who later wrote a college thesis on the incident, \"Black drivers were being arrested while trying to close down the white stations, and we were losing what little money we had bailing them out of jail...White drivers at black stations respected the picket lines. The white drivers at the white ones did not.\"\n\nAccording to Willis, the strike's failure was due to the collective effort of establishment political powers working against the strike: \"With the police arresting our guys, the judges putting guys in jail and holding them for contempt, and the union threatening to kick our leaders out, it was a pretty concerted attack. And we certainly didn't have enough money to get people out of jail at the rate they were putting them in.\"",

When implemented, this legislation would cut 250,000 people off of medical assistance.\n\nOn this day that year, in response to this, Philadelphians living in poverty and homelessness organized through the Kensington Welfare Rights Union (KWRU), began a 140-mile march from Philadelphia to Harrisburg, the capitol of Pennsylvania. On August 31st, they arrived and camped on the front lawn of the Pennsylvania Capitol building, holding a rally there the next day.\n\nIn late September, a federal judge ordered the protesters to leave, however they defied the order, staying until they were forcibly removed by the police on October 3rd. Although the activists were able to speak with Governor Ridge, they were not successful in reversing the welfare reforms. The KWRU continued to organize protests, holding that economic rights and the right to housing, education, food, and a living wage are human rights.",

The dispute is often viewed as the most severe and significant industrial dispute in Irish history.\n\nIn the years leading up to the strike, the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union (ITGWU) had been seeking to unionize and radicalize the Irish workforce. Founded by socialist revolutionary James Larkin in 1908, the ITGWU was the first Irish union to cater to both skilled and unskilled workers.\n\nIn July 1913, three hundred businesses (led by capitalist William Martin Murphy) agreed to not allow the ITGWU to unionize the Dublin workers. Murphy dismissed hundreds of workers of suspected of union membership soon after. Employers in Dublin then locked out their workers, affecting tens of thousands of Irish workers, many of whom were already the poorest in the United Kingdom.\n\nAfter outbreaks of violence between striking workers and strike-breakers, James Connolly, Larkin and ex-British Army Captain Jack White formed a worker's militia, the Irish Citizen Army, to protect workers' demonstrations.\n\nThe lock-out eventually concluded in early 1914, when the Trades Union Congress (TUC) in Britain rejected Larkin and Connolly's request for a sympathetic strike. Most workers, many of whom were on the brink of starvation, went back to work and signed pledges not to join the ITGWU.",

When Sellins intervened, deputies shot and killed her with four bullets and used a cudgel to fracture her skull. Others said that she was attempting to protect miners' children that were on scene.

Although he had inherited an important historic sacred bundle from his father, he was not a hereditary civil chief.\n\nBlack Hawk earned his status as a war chief or captain by his actions; leading raiding and war parties as a young man, and then a band of Sauk warriors during the Black Hawk War of 1832, which was an apparent attempt by Black Hawk to resettle indigenous land lost in the disputed Treaty of St. Louis thirty years prior.\n\nOn August 1st, the \"Battle of Bad Axe\" - effectively a massacre - occurred when Sauk people attempted to surrender. Instead of accepting the surrender, American soldiers gunned them down. Many Sauk people, including children, were shot or drowned while attempting to cross the Mississippi River into safety. Although Black Hawk successfully fled the massacre, it was on this day in 1832 that he surrendered to the American government and was imprisoned.",

Footage of the violence, as well as disruptions on the convention floor, was broadcast internationally, and more than 600 people were arrested.\n\nIn 1967, counterculture and anti-Vietnam War protest groups had been promising to come to Chicago and disrupt the Democratic Nation Convention (DNC), while the city was promising to maintain law and order.\n\nFor eight days, the protesters were met by the Chicago Police Department (CPD) in the streets and parks of Chicago while the U.S. Democratic Party met at the convention in the International Amphitheater. The protests climaxed in what a major report later called a \"police riot\" on August 28th, 1968.\n\nIn defiance of explicit orders by the police, thousands of protesters attempted to march on the streets of Chicago. When they did so, they were \"attacked blitzkrieg fashion by busloads of club-swinging cops\" and beaten and arrested en masse. According to the New York Times, \"onlookers joined the protesters in booing the police. Rolls of toilet paper, bars of soap, and water glasses were thrown at the police from [Hilton] hotel windows, along with a number of rocks, bottles and cherry bombs\".\n\nMore than 600 people were arrested, and more than 100 protesters and cops were treated with injuries that night. So much tear gas was thrown that it could smelled from the hotel suite of Hubert Humphrey, who went on to win the presidential nomination that night.\n\nOn the convention floor, several delegates made statements against Mayor Daley and the CPD, like Senator Abraham Ribicoff who denounced the use of \"Gestapo tactics on the streets of Chicago\" in his speech nominating George McGovern. Subsequently, the \"Walker Report to the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence\" assigned blame for the violence on the police force, calling the incident a \"police riot\".",

        "description": "On this day in 1930, the Swing Riots began, a widespread uprising initiated by English agricultural workers in protest of harsh working conditions and mechanization that was decreasing the number and quality of available of jobs.\n\nThe riots were in protest of agricultural mechanization (which displaced workers) and harsh working conditions. They began with the destruction of threshing machines in the Elham Valley area of East Kent in the summer of 1830, and by early December had spread through the whole of southern England and East Anglia, also destroying workhouses, tithe barns, ricks (hay bales), and maiming cows.\n\nHistorian J. F. C. Harrison concluded that the riots were overwhelmingly the result of the progressive impoverishment and dispossession of the English agricultural workforce over the previous fifty years. The name \"Swing Riots\" was derived from the pseudonym \"Captain Swing\", often signed to the threatening letters sent to farmers, magistrates, parsons, and others. The term \"swing\" was apparently a reference to the swinging stick of the flail used in hand threshing, and Captain Swing was regarded as the mythical figurehead of the rebellion.\n\nThe Swing Riots were a major influence on the Whig Government and, as a part of a wider chain of social unrest, helped pressure the government to pass the Reform Act 1832, the \"Poor Law Amendment Act\" of 1834, which ended \"outdoor relief\" in cash or kind, and the setting up of a chain of workhouses covering larger areas across the country, to which the poor had to go if they wanted help.",

A few years later, he began publishing under his real name (possibly the first public \"coming out\" in modern Western society) and wrote a statement of legal and moral support for a man arrested for homosexual offences.\n\nOn August 29th, 1867 Ulrichs became the first homosexual to speak out publicly in defense of homosexuality when he pleaded at the Congress of German Jurists in Munich for a resolution urging the repeal of anti-homosexual laws. Although he was shouted down and no reform was passed, two years later the Austrian writer Karl-Maria Kertbeny coined the word \"homosexual\", and from the 1870s the subject of sexual orientation in the modern sense began to be widely discussed.\n\nIn Ulrichs' memory, the International Lesbian and Gay Law Association presents a Karl Heinrich Ulrichs Award for distinguished contributions to the advancement of sexual equality.",

The speech was a defining moment of the civil rights movement and among the most iconic speeches in American history. Here is a brief excerpt:\n\n\"In a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the 'unalienable Rights' of 'Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.'\n\nIt is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked \"'insufficient funds.'\"",

On this day in 1958, his force drove off a lynch mob with molotov cocktails. Here is what happened in Baron's own words:\n\n\"When they told us that they were coming to attack that night I went around and told all the people that was living in the area to withdraw that night. The women I told them to keep pots, kettles of hot water boiling, get some caustic soda and if anyone tried to break down the door and come in, to just lash out with them.\n\nThe men, well we were armed...Make no mistake, there were iron bars, there were machetes, there were all kinds of arms, weapons, we had guns. We made preparations at the headquarters for the attack. We had men on the housetop waiting for them...'Let's burn the niggers, let's lynch the niggers.'

The FBI tried to subvert his activities in Chicago, sowing disinformation among these groups and placing a counterintelligence operative in the local Panthers. In December 1969, Hampton was assassinated during a predawn raid at his Chicago apartment by the Chicago Police Department. During the raid, Panther Mark Clark was also killed.\n\nAt a press conference the next day, the police announced the arrest team had been attacked by the \"violent\" and \"extremely vicious\" Panthers, and had defended themselves accordingly. In another press conference, police leadership praised the assault team for their \"remarkable restraint\" and \"professional discipline\" in not killing all the Panthers present. Photographic evidence was presented of bullet holes allegedly made by shots fired by the Panthers, but this was soon challenged. Later, it was found that all but one of nearly one hundred shots were fired by the police.",

The FBI became aware of several gifts Seberg had made to the BPP, totaling just over $10k in contributions. The FBI operation against Seberg, directly overseen by J. Edgar Hoover, began to harass, intimidate, defame, and discredit Seberg.\n\nThe FBI's stated goal was an unspecified \"neutralization\" of Seberg with a subsidiary objective to \"cause her embarrassment and serve to cheapen her image with the public\", while taking the \"usual precautions to avoid identification of the Bureau\". The FBI spread a false rumor about her pregnancy, claiming she was bearing the child of a BPP member, which was repeated frequently in the press. She was also effectively blacklisted from Hollywood films at this time.\n\nOn this day in 1979, she committed suicide, writing \"Forgive me. I can no longer live with my nerves\". Romain Gary, Seberg's second husband, called a press conference shortly after Seberg's death, publicly blaming the FBI's campaign against her for her deteriorating mental health.",

By September 1st, enough of the country had gone on strike that the occupying Nazi government declared a national state of emergency.\n\nWithin hours, the strike leaders were rounded up and interrogated by the Gestapo. Twenty strike leaders were summarily tried by a special tribunal, sentenced to death, transferred to the Hinzert concentration camp, and executed. Two thousand Luxembourgers were arrested, 83 were tried by the special tribunal and transferred to the Gestapo. 290 high school children, boys and girls, were arrested and sent to re-education camps in Germany.",

A speaker addressed them in front of the station, and the tension grew so high that when Joel Hunter, Chief Administrator of the Charities, asked for the selection of a committee to present the grievances of the crowd, there was a move to storm the station.

Claiming the man had been assaulted, the group staged a passive sit-in and blocked a prison officer from locking a door.\n\nThe protest escalated into destruction of prison property and outright rebellion. By the next day, inmates had control of two-thirds of the jail. Over the next four days, they caused \u00a34m worth of damage. The rebelling prisoners made three demands: one, that the deputy regional director of prisons and chairman of the board of visitors and his deputy would be present at the surrender; two, that Irish prisoners would not be singled out for special treatment, they would all be treated the same as other prisoners; three, that prisoners wanted to be received by their own officers from Hull.\n\nThese demands, along with a promise to end brutality from guards, led to the prisoners' peaceful surrender on September 3rd. Upon re-entering the prison, however, many of the prisoners were severely beaten. Hull prison itself remained closed for a year, so extensive was the damage done to it.",

        "description": "During the month of September 1920, a widespread occupation of Italian factories by their workers took place. Although originating in the auto factories, steel mills, and machine tool plants of the metal sector, the occupation/revolt spread to cotton mills and hosiery firms, lignite mines, tire factories, breweries and distilleries, and steamships and warehouses in port towns. At its height about 600,000 workers were involved.\n\nThe worker rebellion was the culmination of years of labor strife - weeks before the occupations, the Italian Federation of Metalurgical Workers (FIOM), the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), and the General Confederation of Labor (CGL) called for \"obstructionism\" (essentially, a work slowdown) to be applied in all the engineering factories and shipyards starting on August 21st.\n\nBy the 24th, production at the Romeo factory in Milan came to a complete standstill. A week later, production at the FIAT-Centro plant was reduced by 60%. On the morning of the 30th, the 2000 workers of the Romeo plant found the gates locked and the factory surrounded by troops. The FIOM responded by calling on its members to occupy the 300 engineering factories in Milan. Historian Lynn Williams describes what happened next:\n\n\"Between the 1st and 4th of September metal workers occupied factories throughout the Italian peninsula...the occupations rolled forward not only in the industrial heartland around Milan, Turin and Genoa but in Rome, Florence, Naples and Palermo, in a forest of red and black flags and a fanfare of workers bands...Within three days 400,000 workers were in occupation. As the movement spread to other sectors, the total rose to over half a million.\"\n\nAlthough some radical elements within the workers' movement (Antonio Gramsci, the Italian Syndicalist Union) called for revolution, referring to the occupations as \"an expropriating general strike\" and demanding total socialization of the economy, more moderate forces (the CGL) prevailed, using the pressure of the rebellion to cut a deal with employers, granting better conditions to the workers on the condition of returning to work.",

Realizing that the men needed help, he joined the Alabama Sharecroppers' Union in 1931.\n\nIn 1931, when the Communist Party arrived in Alabama, Cobb was profoundly impressed with them because he was aware that the party was defending the Scottsboro Boys, nine young black men accused of raping two white women.\n\nIn December 1932, a sheriff tried to take the home and livestock of one of Cobb's friends. Cobb defended his friend and in turn was involved in a shootout in which he was wounded and arrested. Cobb was sentenced to thirteen years in jail.\n\nCobb was offered parole if he would agree to give up his farm and relocate to Birmingham. Instead, he served his full sentence and, after release in 1945, returned to his farm.\n\nCobb was one of the most successful black men in the highly Jim Crow-ed county and lived to the age of 89.

The Proclamation led directly to war with France, which concluded in the country being divided between French and self-rule at the 17th parallel.\n\nThe Proclamation quoted heavily from the American Declaration of Independence and was vehemently critical of French rule. An excerpt reads:\n\n\"'All men are created equal. They are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, among them are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.' This immortal statement was made in the Declaration of Independence of the United States of America in 1776. In a broader sense, this means: All the peoples on the earth are equal from birth, all the peoples have a right to live, to be happy and free.\n\n...Nevertheless, for more than eighty years, the French imperialists, abusing the standard of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity, have violated our Fatherland and oppressed our fellow-citizens. They have acted contrary to the ideals of humanity and justice. In the field of politics, they have deprived our people of every democratic liberty...They have built more prisons than schools. They have mercilessly slain our patriots; they have drowned our uprisings in rivers of blood...They have robbed us of our rice fields, our mines, our forests, and our raw materials.\n\nFor these reasons, we, members of the Provisional Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, solemnly declare to the world that Vietnam has the right to be a free and independent country - and in fact is so already.

The riot, and resulting massacre of immigrant Chinese miners by white immigrant miners, was the result of racial prejudice toward the Chinese miners, who were perceived to be taking jobs from their white counterparts.\n\nThe Union Pacific Coal Department found it economically beneficial to give preference in hiring to Chinese miners, who were willing to work for lower wages than their white counterparts, angering the white miners. When the rioting ended, at least 28 Chinese miners were dead and 15 were injured. Rioters burned 78 Chinese homes, resulting in approximately $150,000 in property damage.\n\nMost of the Chinese population fled Rock Springs after this incident. This was only one episode of anti-Chinese violence among many; Chinese immigrants were often terrorized and discriminated against in this period of American history.",

George and Karl Marx were aware of each other and feuded over conflicting ideas about the nature of capitalism.\n\nHis writing was immensely popular in 19th century America. His most famous work, Progress and Poverty (1879), sold millions of copies worldwide, probably more than any other American book before that time. The book investigates the paradox of increasing inequality and poverty amid economic and technological progress, the cyclic nature of industrialized economies, and the use of rent capture such as land value tax and other anti-monopoly reforms as a remedy for these and other social problems.",

Due to President Roosevelt's labor reforms, union membership grew greatly leading up to the strike - the United Textile Workers (UTW), which had no more than 15,000 members in February 1933, grew to 250,000 members by June 1934, of whom roughly half were cotton mill workers.\n\nOn September 3rd, thousands of workers took the streets in Gastonia, North Carolina to form a parade celebrating Labor Day, and the next day approximately 20,000 out of the 25,000 textile workers in the county were out on strike. Hundreds of thousands of textile workers across the country soon followed suit.\n\nStrikers faced violence from both state police, private citizens, and private guards for the mills - Governor Blackwood of South Carolina announced that he would deputize the state's \"mayors, sheriffs, peace officers and every good citizen\" to maintain order, and accordingly, dozens of protesting workers were killed as martial law was declared and private guards fired into crowds across the country.\n\nResults of the strike were mixed, but workers in the South fared particularly badly. Thousands of striking mill workers did not return to the mills, many others were blacklisted, and some union officials claimed victory, despite worker demands not being met. Southern mill workers were in particular were extremely bitter at the union and its officials for calling off the strike and putting their faith in government boards, when the employers had conceded nothing.",

The killings happened when members of the New Orleans Police Department (NOPD), allegedly responding to a call of an officer under fire, shot and killed two civilians - 17-year-old James Brissette and 40-year-old Ronald Madison. Four other civilians were also wounded. All of the victims were black and unarmed, and one, Ronald Madison, was mentally handicapped.\n\nThe NOPD attempted to cover-up the murders, falsely reporting that seven police officers responded to a police dispatch reporting an officer down, and that at least four suspects were firing weapons at the officers upon their arrival.\n\nAn attorney for the Justice Department described the case as \"the most significant police misconduct prosecution [in the U.S.] since the Rodney King beating case\". On April 20th, 2016, the five former officers pleaded guilty to various charges related to the shooting, and in return received reduced sentences ranging from three to twelve years. Three of the officers are white and two are black.",

During the next three weeks, school strikes spread in a rapidly accelerating 'wave', affecting at least 62 town and cities, stretching as far north as Montrose in Scotland and as far south as Portsmouth, involving thousands of children.\n\nReasons for striking ranged from a desire to abolish the cane, less school work, more holidays, and payment for school monitors. Widespread school strikes are very rare events, with the exception of similar strikes in 1889, the scale of the 1911 strike represents a unique example of collective action by mainly working class school children.",

The trial was unusual in the way that the prosecution did not try to demonstrate the guilt of individuals, but rather to indict the IWW as a whole, by reading inflammatory passages from seized documents; accordingly, the defense testified about the plight of the working man and the evils of capitalism.\n\nAll defendants were found guilty on all charges brought by the prosecution, and many IWW members served several years in prison.

On March 2nd, 1955, she was arrested at the age of fifteen in Montgomery, Alabama for refusing to give up her seat to a white woman on a crowded, segregated bus. This occurred nine months before the more widely known incident in which Rosa Parks, secretary of the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), helped spark the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott.\n\nFor many years, Montgomery's black leaders did not publicize Colvin's pioneering effort. She was an unmarried teenager at the time, and was reportedly impregnated by a married man. It is widely accepted that Colvin was not accredited by the civil rights campaigners at the time due to her pregnancy shortly after the incident, with even Rosa Parks saying \"If the white press got ahold of that information, they would have [had] a field day. They'd call her a bad girl, and her case wouldn't have a chance.\"\n\nColvin left Montgomery for New York City in 1958, because she had difficulty finding and keeping work following her participation in the federal court case that overturned bus segregation (similarly, Rosa Parks left Montgomery for Detroit in 1957). Colvin stated she was branded a troublemaker by many in her community. She withdrew from college and went on to become a nurse in Manhattan.",

The revolt was not well-taken in the press. The Irish Times wrote \"To-day Irish Labour is permeated with a spirit of revolt against all the principles and conventions of ordered society. The country's lawless state in recent months is partly responsible for this sinister development, and the wild teachings of the Russian Revolution have fallen on willing ears.\"",

Before his execution, Czolgosz explained \"I killed the President because he was the enemy of the good people - the good working people...I am not sorry for my crime\".\n\nThe aftermath of the assassination saw a backlash against anarchist movements. Several anarchists, including Emma Goldman, were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the attack, and vigilantes attacked anarchist colonies and newspapers. Fear of the movement also led to government surveillance programs of anarchists, which were eventually consolidated on a federal level when the Bureau of Investigation (BOI, later to become the FBI) was formed in 1908.",

Imoudu started labor union activities as a member of the Railway Workers Union (RWU), which became one of the most militant unions in the country during the colonial period. The union was formed in 1931 at a time where many trade organizations were more similar to social undertakings than an industrial movement.\n\nImoudu was released from prison by the government in 1945, presumably as a means to de-escalate labor tensions. A large rally was held to welcome him back to Lagos, however, and on the 21st and 22nd of June 1945, Imoudu led a radical wing of the organized union to organize a general strike that became an important moment in Nigeria's history.",

Fish-Harnack even sent the Soviets information about the forthcoming Operation Barbarossa.\n\nUnfortunately, the Gestapo were able to decode the group's messages. On this day in 1942, Arvid Harnack and Mildred Fish-Harnack were arrested while on a weekend outing. Arvid was executed that December and Mildred was executed February the following year.\n\nMildred's last words were purported to have been: \"Ich habe Deutschland auch so geliebt\" (\"I loved Germany so much as well\").

The protests quickly spread to other companies, and by the following day somewhere between 20,000 - 30,000 workers from multiple industries were refusing to work.\n\nOn September 10th, the would-be second day of a general strike, the German Reichskommissar Josef Terboven declared martial law in Oslo and the neighboring municipality Aker and executed two union leaders, Viggo Hansteen and Rolf Wickstr\u00f8m. Three others, Ludvik Buland, Harry Vestli and Josef Larsson were also sentenced to death, but their convictions were changed to imprisonment for life in German jails. According to one eye-witness account, nearly three hundred were arrested.\n\nAfter the milk strike, the Norwegian Confederation of Unions underwent \"Nazification\", with members of the Fascist party \"Nasjonal Samling\" installed as leaders. The Nazification also applied to other parts of a civil society - the Oslo police chief, the future Prime Minister, and many university staff were also arrested in the aftermath of the strike.

In August 1966, the AWOC and the NFWA merged to create the United Farm Workers (UFW) Organizing Committee.\n\nThe Delano Grape Strike is notable for the effective implementation and adaptation of boycotts, the unprecedented partnership between Filipino and Mexican farm workers to unionize farm labor, and the creation of the UFW labor union, all of which revolutionized the farm labor movement in America.",

His leadership style was aggressive, and the relatively moderate American Federation of Labor (AFL) sought to undermine his influence in the strike, although their efforts failed due to worker loyalty to Gold.\n\nAlthough the strike was ultimately successful due to Gold's efforts, the AFL expelled him, accusing Gold and other strike leaders of debauchery, wasting union money, bribery, forcing workers to join the Communist Party, among other grievances. Despite this, he remained a powerful figure within the organized labor of the fur industry, often competing directly with AFL-backed unions for influence among workers.\n\nGold was also a victim of anti-communist purges on many occasions. In 1950, Gold resigned from the Communist Party and signed an anti-communist oath related to the Taft-Hartley Act. The Justice Department argued that Gold had not really resigned, and indicted him for perjury in August 1953 one day before the statute of limitations ran out. Although he was successfully convicted, Gold managed to get the conviction overturned on appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court (Gold v. United States) and all charges were dropped.",

While being escorted by her captors, Quinteros suddenly jumped over the wall of the Venezuelan Embassy, calling out her name and asking for sanctuary. The embassy staff attempted to help her, but her captors managed to thwart the escape.\n\nA few days later, she was tortured and killed. Her kidnapping and murder grew into a major diplomatic incident that eventually culminated in Venezuela cutting off diplomatic relations with Uruguay In October 2002, Judge Eduardo Cavalli found former minister Juan Carlos Blanco primarily responsible for the disappearance of Elena Quinteros and had him arraigned on charges of deprivation of liberty.",

Both sides fought, armed with staves, sticks and pickaxe handles. The anti-fascists also used various missiles including stones, half-bricks, knuckledusters and potatoes with razor blades inserted into them.\n\nPolice made no arrests that day.

At the time, Korea was being divided into two occupation zones, with the Soviet Union occupying the north, and the United States occupying the south.\n\nBased on a network of people's committees, it presented a program of radical social change, including seizing Japanese-owned land and redistributing it to peasants, universal suffrage, female equality, an eight-hour work day, and abolition of child labor.\n\nThe government was short-lived however - in the south, the US military government outlawed the PRK on December 12th, 1945, while in the north, the Soviet authorities co-opted the committees into the structure of the emerging Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea).\n\nThe PRK is significant today because it was the first Korean political organization to implement local autonomy in the form of the people's committees. More than 140 committees were established nationwide in response to the support of the people.",

As some protesters chanted 'police protect Nazi scum', the neo-fascists were divided into groups of twenty and escorted out of the area. While they waited for their buses the anti-fascists threw rocks, stones and bottles at them. As the police moved in with batons and riot shields, both sides jeered and spat on the officers.\n\nThe event was canceled to, according to police, \"protect the public\".

The strike soon spread to schools nearby which, according to the Hull Daily News, made local tradesmen \"anxious about the whereabouts of their errand boys\".\n\nAccording to historian Clive Bloom, most of these children had to go to work after school to help feed their families.

The goal of the conflict was to attain independence for both Portuguese Guinea and Cape Verde.\n\nCabral was assassinated on January 20th, 1973 (likely by a Portugal-backed assassin) about eight months before Guinea-Bissau's unilateral declaration of independence.

The centerpiece of his policy was an agrarian reform law, under which uncultivated portions of large land-holdings were expropriated in return for compensation and redistributed to poverty-stricken agricultural laborers. Approximately 500,000 people benefited from the decree, the majority of them were indigenous people, whose forebears had been dispossessed after the Spanish invasion.\n\nOpposition to these policies caused the United Fruit Company to lobby the United States government to have him overthrown.

For two days, ships of the Royal Navy at Invergordon were in open mutiny, one of the few military strikes in British history.\n\nThe rebellion was caused because of widespread pay cuts initiated by the British government, as part of its attempts to deal with the Great Depression. In the Navy this translated into a 10% pay cut for officers and senior ratings, and a 25% cut for ratings below petty officer who had joined before 1925.\n\nOn the morning of September 15th, sailors on four capital ships due to sail had already begun to refuse orders. On the Hood and the Nelson, crews carried out the ordinary harbor routine, refusing to put to sea; on the Valiant and the Rodney, crews carried out only essential duties, including the provision of safety patrols and fire guards, and did so without any recourse to their officers.\n\nBy the second day, the pay cuts had been mitigated, with the lower ranked members only receiving a 10% pay cut. A number of the organizers of the strike were jailed, while 200 sailors were discharged from the service. The mutiny caused a panic on the London Stock Exchange and a run on the pound, bringing Britain's economic troubles to a head and forcing it off the Gold Standard.",

In October, some workers began flinging mud and destroying factory fences with axes, presumably to scare off some scabs that had replaced them. This behavior scandalized the strike and damaged some public support of it.\n\nThe strike was initially unsuccessful, but, following a similar strike in 1848, a law was passed limiting the working day to 10 hours. Unfortunately, this achievement was undercut by an amendment that allowed workers to sign a contract allowing the workday to increase back to 12 hours.",

That afternoon, former minister and former union leader Errol Cova announced a general strike that would begin on September 15th.\n\nOn that day, the general strike began and caused massive power outages that affected up to 80% of the island. The lack of air conditioning in the hot climate was frustrating for both locals and tourists.

Around 11,600 workers were involved in the strike, which affected the wages sustaining 43,000 people, or about 26% of the population of metropolitan Sudbury. By the end of the strike, the company had been starved of over twenty-two million hours of labor.\n\nThe workers won small wage increase and a pension package, however thousands of workers lost their homes and cars because of the length of the strike. According to journalist Amy Miller, since 1979, INCO has fired 20,000 employees from their staff and now have more people receiving payments from the pension roll than pay roll.",

Being aware of what the Fascist Italian government did to the Ethiopians, and also the way that I and all the rest of the Negroes in this country have been treated ever since slavery, I figured I had a pretty good idea of what fascism was...\"\n\nSACB: \"Mr. Morgan, were those thoughts in your mind before you went to Spain?\"\n\nMorgan: \"Ever since I have been big enough to understand things I have rebelled. As a small child of three or four years old I would rebel at human injustice in the way I understood it at that age. And as long as I have been able to remember, up until now, the government and a lot of people have treated me as a second-class citizen. I am 43 years old, and all my life I have been treated as a second-class citizen, and naturally if you always have been treated like one you start feeling it at a very tender age.\n\nWith Hitler on the march, and fascism starting the fight in Spain, I felt that it could serve two purposes: I felt that if we cold lick the Fascists in Spain, I felt that in the trend of things it would offset a bloodbath later. I felt that if we didn't lick Franco and stop fascism there, it would spread over lots of the world. And it is bad enough for white people to live under fascism, those of the white people that like freedom and democracy. But Negroes couldn't live under it. They would be wiped out.\"",

Flores Mag\u00f3n organized with the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and edited the Mexican anarchist newspaper \"Regeneraci\u00f3n\". He has been considered an important participant in the social movement that sparked the Mexican Revolution.\n\nAfter his works were banned in Mexico, Ricardo fled to the United States, where he would remain for the rest of his life. Arrested multiple times, his final arrest came he was charged and convicted with sedition under the Espionage Act of 1917, and he was sentenced to twenty years for \"obstructing the war effort\", a violation of the Act. Mag\u00f3n died at Leavenworth Penitentiary in Kansas, and speculation remains today about whether he died of natural causes or was murdered by prison guards.",

He also played a pivotal role among neo-folkloric musicians who established the Nueva Canci\u00f3n Chilena (New Chilean Song) movement. This led to an uprising of new sounds in popular music during the administration of President Salvador Allende.\n\nJust a few days after the coup that ousted Allende from power, Jara was arrested, tortured, and killed by the dictatorship of Augusto Pincochet. Jara is one of many \"desaparecidos\", people who vanished under the Pinochet government and were most likely tortured and killed. Thirty-six years after his first burial, he received a full funeral on December 3rd, 2009 in Santiago.",

She was highly critical of the existing political system in Japan, which led her to call for an anarchism to exist in \"everyday practice\", namely that people should in various small ways seek routinely to undermine the kokutai (a sense of national body politic). It\u014d also translated anarchist writings into Japanese, including works of Emma Goldman.\n\nOn this day in 1923, It\u014d, \u014csugi, and his 6-year-old nephew Munekazu were arrested, strangled to death, and thrown into an abandoned well by a squad of military police known as the \"Kenpeitai\". The killing of such high-profile anarchists, together with a young child, became a national controversy known as the \"Amakasu Incident\" (named after the leader of the squad). Lt. Amakasu was arrested and sentenced to ten years in prison for the murders, however he was released after serving only three years.",

They then left to Lagun, where they freed 22 slaves from jail and went from farm to farm, liberating more and more slaves.\n\nAfter being defeated in open battle, rebels began a guerrilla campaign, poisoning wells and stealing food. On this day in 1795, Tula and Karpata were betrayed by a fellow slave. They were taken prisoner, and the war was effectively over. After Tula was captured, he was publicly tortured to death on October 3rd that year.\n\nSlaves were granted more freedom on the island as a result of the uprising, although the system of slavery was not formally abolished until 1863. Today, August 17th is celebrated in Cura\u00e7ao to commemorate the beginning of the liberation struggle. The uprising was dramatized in the 2013 Dutch film \"Tula: The Revolt\".",

In protest of the expulsion, former representative Phillip Joiner led a 25 mile march to Camilla, the county seat on this day in 1868. There, they were attacked by an armed white mob - approximately a dozen marchers were killed and 30-40 wounded. The Camilla Massacre began the era of de facto voting discrimination and political disenfranchisement of the black population in Georgia.\n\nAlthough the expelled legislators eventually won a case in the Georgia Supreme Court (White v. Clements) that gave them the right to hold office, voter intimidation and de facto voting discrimination heightened to such a degree that Georgia went almost sixty years without having a single black legislator in its state congress, although they were legally allowed to do so.",

Through this popular pressure, a bill was passed that granted women the right to vote.\n\nIt's worth noting that, in Polynesian society (and by extension M\u0101ori people), charismatic women were given significant direct influence (although this was limited by the inability of women to speak at some meetings in community houses). As a result, some historians see colonialism as initially regressive for women's rights in New Zealand.",

His descriptions of the unsanitary and inhumane conditions that workers suffered served to shock and galvanize readers. Jack London called Sinclair's book \"the Uncle Tom's Cabin of wage slavery\", and it caused the domestic and foreign purchases of American meat fell by half, leading to federal regulation of the meat industry.\n\nIt is worth noting that Sinclair was a racist. With the income from \"The Jungle\", he founded the utopian community Helicon Home Colony in Englewood, New Jersey, which excluded black and Jewish people. The colony burned down under suspicious circumstances within a year.\n\nIn the 1920s, Sinclair moved to Monrovia, California (near Los Angeles), where he founded the state's chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. In 1934, Sinclair ran in the California gubernatorial election as a Democrat. Sinclair's platform, known as the End Poverty in California movement (EPIC), galvanized the support of the Democratic Party.

Although the owners of the factory attempted to evict the workers, courts ruled in favor of the workers when they claimed that they were simply holding a lengthy staff meeting.\n\nWhen news of the occupation spread, some leftists traveled to Nordhausen and suggested beginning worker-managed production of bicycles. Although the striking workers were skeptical initially, they eventually warmed up to the idea. On this day in 2007, the striking workers announced their plan to begin producing a limited edition \"Strike Bike\". Bought as a pre-order to help initiate production, the Strike Bike quickly sold out and production was set to begin on October 22nd.",

He was the first Prime Minister and President of Ghana, having led the Gold Coast to independence from Britain in 1957. An influential advocate of pan-Africanism, Nkrumah was a founding member of the Organization of African Unity and winner of the Lenin Peace Prize from the Soviet Union in 1962.\n\nIn 1960, Ghanaians approved a new constitution and elected Nkrumah President. His administration funded national industrial and energy projects, developed a strong national education system and promoted a pan-Africanist culture. Under Nkrumah, Ghana played a leading role in African international relations during the decolonization period.\n\nIn 1964, a constitutional amendment made Ghana a one-party state, with Nkrumah as president for life of both the nation and its party. Nkrumah was deposed in 1966 by the National Liberation Council which under the supervision of international financial institutions privatized many of the country's state corporations. John Stockwell, a former CIA agent, wrote that the CIA was intimately involved in the coup that ousted him from power.\n\nNkrumah lived the rest of his life in Guinea, of which he was named honorary co-president.",

By March 1st, 1951, the Act had excluded 54,000 people of German ethnic origin and 12,000 displaced Russian persons from entering the United States.\n\nAlthough the law is still in effect today, many of its most controversial provisions have been directly repealed or ruled unconstitutional, such as laws regarding detention of political dissidents, banning communists from working for the government, and having to register with the government. One provision still legal, however, allows the military to \"regulate\" weapons held by private citizens (50 U.S.C. \u00a7 797).",

In response the community followed and spied on water inspectors, in order to prevent them from shutting off the water supply to various homes.\n\nLegal action escalated, and some residents were called into court over unpaid water charges.

For the well-being of both the women and the culture, she argued, parity of the sexes is essential.\n\nThe year \"Equality Between the Sexes\" was published coincided with the publication of The \"Feminine Mystique\" by Betty Friedan, another notable feminist text. Professor Rossi's argument was considered subversive at the time, and in later interviews she recalled being called a monster, an unnatural woman, and an unfit mother. In 1966, Rossi, along with Betty Friedan and others, founded the National Organization for Women (NOW).",

His activities were met with threats of reprisal by the white community, and Lee became one of the movement's earliest victims to white violence. On this day in 1961, Lee was murdered by Mississippi state representative E. H. Hurst (1908 - 1990) in broad daylight at the cotton gin while delivering cotton near Liberty.\n\nHurst killed Lee with a single shot to the head, but later claimed in court that he was defending himself after Lee attacked him with a tire iron. An all-white jury ruled that the killing was a justifiable homicide. In 1964, civil rights activist Louis Allen was killed after he informed federal investigators that his testimony in the case was forced on threat of violence.",

Notably, due to political differences with the Communist Party, the Labour Party did not attend.\n\nWhen Mosley attempted to give a speech from atop a van, the protesters surrounded the van and sang the Red Flag in order to drown out Mosley's speech. Many threw stones at the Fascists, with at least one hitting Mosley in the temple. Outnumbered and facing violence, the BUF members dispersed. The Battle of Holbeck Moor happened just a week prior to the more well-known Battle of Cable Street, in which a BUF rally led by Oswald Mosley was again forcibly dispersed by anti-fascist demonstrators.",

Singh was an avid reader of Bakunin, Marx, Lenin, and Trotsky. He was also openly critical of Mahatma Gandhi, having become disillusioned with his non-violent praxis after Gandhi called off the non-co-operation movement.\n\nIn December 1928, Bhagat Singh and an associate fatally shot a 21-year-old British police officer, John Saunders, in retaliation for the death of Lala Lajpat Rai, a popular Indian nationalist leader who died after being attacked by police. On the run from the police, Singh was arrested when he, along with Batukeshwar Dutt, exploded two improvised bombs inside the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi, showered leaflets onto the legislators below, and allowed the authorities to arrest them.\n\nAwaiting trial, Singh gained public sympathy after he joined fellow defendant Jatin Das in a hunger strike, demanding better prison conditions for Indian prisoners. Das died from starvation in September 1929. Singh was convicted and hanged in March, 1931. Four days before his execution, Singh refused to sign a letter drafted for him that would appeal for clemency.",

Du Bois, Martin Luther King, and Malcolm X. Not surprisingly, the text infuriated southern slaveowners; the state of Georgia offered a $10,000 bounty for Walker alive and $1,000 for him dead.\n\nWalker died the next year, soon after publishing the third edition of his Appeal. Although foul play was suspected, historians consider it more likely he died of tuberculosis, which his daughter had passed away from a week prior. David Walker's son, Edward G. Walker, was an attorney and, in 1866, was one of the first two black men elected to the Massachusetts State Legislature.",

Segregationists were protesting the enrollment of James Meredith, a black veteran, at the University of Mississippi (known as Ole Miss) at Oxford, Mississippi. Two civilians, one a French journalist, were killed during the night, and over 300 people were injured, including one-third of the federal law enforcement personnel deployed.\n\nIn anticipation of violence, Meredith was escorted by Federal Marshals and state police immediately after arriving in Oxford. Responding to the federal presence, a crowd of a thousand, mostly students\u2060 - led by arch-conservative activist Edwin Walker\u2060\u2060\u2060 - quickly crowded onto campus. As the night went on, the crowd swelled to 3,000 and became increasingly violent. Early the next morning, a white mob attacked Genenal Billingslea's staff car as it arrived at the university, setting it on fire with the staff inside.\n\nOn October 1st, Meredith became the first African-American student to be enrolled at the University of Mississippi. With 24-hour military security, he graduated from the university on August 18th, 1963 with a degree in political science.",

The event came to be widely known as the \"Jerry Rescue\".\n\nJerry himself was hidden in Syracuse for several days, then was taken to the Orson Ames House in Mexico, New York, and from there to Oswego, before crossing Lake Ontario into freedom in Canada.

There, they threw rocks at the police, chanting \"Kill the police!\". Violence broke out, and the U.S.-led government brought in strikebreakers, declared martial law, and put down the rebellion by force with U.S. soldiers and tanks.\n\nIn total, the rebellion resulted in killing of 38 policemen, 163 civil workers, and 73 civilians. The defeat of the uprising is considered to be a turning point in establishing political control over Korea, as the PRK people's committees and the National Council of Korean Labor Unions were weakened by the suppression.",

On this day in 1838, the first major group of Cherokee, more than 12,000 people in hundreds of covered wagons, were forced out of Tennessee, traveling westward from the town of Red Clay.\n\nTaking the journey through an unusually cold winter, they suffered terribly from exposure, disease, and starvation, killing several thousand people while en route to their new designated reserve. They were also attacked by locals and economically exploited - starving Indians were charged a dollar a head (equal to $24.01 today) to cross the Ohio River, which typically charged twelve cents, equal to $2.88 today.\n\nThe name \"Trail of Tears\" comes at least in part from the description of a Choctaw leader of the journey, who called it \"a trail of tears and death\".",

And we have already begun to remedy the situation. Three hundred Haitians are now dead in B\u00e1nica. This remedy will continue.\"\n\nIn the following week, hundreds of Dominican troops poured into the region, killing Haitians with rifles, machetes, shovels, knives, and bayonets. Haitian children were reportedly thrown in the air and caught by soldiers' bayonets, then thrown on their mothers' corpses. Others were drowned in the sea, making identification and counting of the dead impossible.\n\nThe term \"Parsley Massacre\" for the genocide came from the method that Dominican soldiers would use to determine whether or not those living on the border were native Afro-Dominicans or immigrant Afro-Haitians - they would hold up a sprig of parsley to someone and ask them what it was. If the person could pronounce it the Spanish way (\"perejil\"), the soldiers considered them Dominican and let them live, however if they pronounced it with a French or Creole accent, they were considered Haitian and executed.",

Notably, Catholics and Protestants set aside their differences to unite in class struggle.\n\nAfter negotiations with the relief workers fell through, they called a rent strike, lit bonfires in working class districts, and speakers from the strike committee addressed thousands. Thousands of police were called in. Over the next several days, protesters clashed in battles with police and many workers were killed and injured.\n\nWorkers won most of their demands, including big cash increases in their relief pay.

Geehan and the other RWG members who were on the strike committee were heavily criticized for ending the strike before winning this demand.",

        "description": "The Battle of Cable Street was an event that took place in Cable Street and Whitechapel in the East End of London on Sunday this day in 1936. It was a clash between the Metropolitan Police, sent to protect a march by members of the British Union of Fascists led by Oswald Mosley, and various anti-fascist demonstrators, including local anarchist, communist, Jewish and socialist groups.\n\nAfter it became known that the British Union of Fascists (BUF) were organizing a march to take place through the heart of the East End (an area which then had a large Jewish population), an estimated 100,000 residents of the area petitioned then Home Secretary John Simon to ban the march because of the strong likelihood of violence. He refused, and sent a police escort in an attempt to prevent anti-fascist protesters from disrupting the march.\n\nAnti-fascists built roadblocks in an attempt to prevent the march from happening, and on Oct. 4th an estimated 20,000 anti-fascist demonstrators turned out, met by 6,000\u20137,000 policemen (including mounted police) and 2,000\u20133,000 fascists. The demonstrators fought the police with sticks, rocks, chair legs and other improvised weapons. Rubbish, rotten vegetables and the contents of chamber pots were thrown at the police by women in houses along the street.\n\nThe leader of the BUF, Edward Mosley, decided to abandon the march and fascists fled through Hyde Park while the anti-fascists rioted with police. More than 150 demonstrators were arrested and approximately 175 people, including police, women, and children, were injured in the violence.",

Freight handlers from the Southern Pacific line also struck, ending any work on the port.\n\nDuring the second week of the strike, employers launched strong attempts to create a racial break among the black and white strikers. Shippers also revived the White League, a group designed to intimidate black strikers. Despite the attempts, strikers remained united, with some unions noting that if the employers played successfully played one racial group against the other, they would all face starvation wages. The strike lasted twenty days, ending on October 24th, and striking workers won most of their demands.",

Here is a short excerpt from the speech he gave:\n\n\"Let me say to those who are listening to me now that I speak not only on behalf of Burkina Faso, my country which I love so much, but also on behalf of all those who suffer, wherever they may be.\n\nI speak on behalf of those millions of human beings who are in ghettos because their skin is black, or because they have a different kind of culture, those whose status is hardly higher than that of an animal.\n\nI suffer, too, on behalf of those Indians who have been massacred, trampled on and humiliated and who, for centuries, have been confined to reservations, so that they do not have any aspirations to any rights whatsoever, so that their culture cannot become enriched through contact with other cultures, including that of the invader.\n\nI speak out on behalf of those who are unemployed because of a structurally unjust system which has now been completely disrupted, the unemployed who have been reduced to seeing their lives as only the reflection of the lives of those who have more than themselves.\n\nI speak on behalf of women throughout the entire world who suffer from a system of exploitation imposed on them by men\".",

On May 17th, while out of bail from a similar act six months prior, Berrigan and eight other Catholic activists walked into the offices of the local draft board in Catonsville, Maryland, removed 600 draft records, doused them in napalm, and burnt them in a lot outside of the building.\n\nThe group issued a statement, saying \"We confront the Roman Catholic Church, other Christian bodies, and the synagogues of America with their silence and cowardice in the face of our country's crimes. We are convinced that the religious bureaucracy in this country is racist, is an accomplice in this war, and is hostile to the poor.\" All nine were sentenced to three years in prison.",

Hamer is credited with coining the phrase \"Mississippi appendectomy\" as a euphemism for the involuntary or uninformed sterilization of black women, common in the South in the 1960s.\n\nHamer was extorted, threatened, harassed, shot at, and assaulted by white supremacists and police while trying to register for and exercise her right to vote. She later helped and encouraged thousands of African-Americans in Mississippi to become registered voters, and helped hundreds of disenfranchised people in her area through her work in programs like the Freedom Farm Cooperative, which she formed to subvert state oppression of black people in the agricultural industry.",

The same evening, Hill arrived at a doctor's office with a gunshot wound, and briefly mentioned a fight over a woman. He refused to explain further, even after he was accused of the grocery store murders on the basis of his injury.\n\nHill was convicted of the murders in a controversial trial and executed on November 19th, despite widespread calls for clemency, including from President Woodrow Wilson and Helen Keller.",

Once there, Guevara had difficulty getting co-operation from both local dissidents and the Bolivian Communist Party, despite besting the Bolivian military in several skirmishes.\n\nMany of the inhabitants willingly informed the Bolivian authorities and military about the guerrillas and their movements in the area, which led directly to Guevara's capture on October 7th, 1967.

Workers demanded housing, rights for temporary workers, wages to follow regional differences in the cost of living, and clearer standards for promotions.\n\nThe government did not respond for three months, assuming the strike would collapse due to economic pressure. Workers had prepared for this, however, taking up community collections, the community exiling strikebreaking workers, and women of the household economically sustaining families while workers were on strike.\n\nOn March 19th, the workers' union accepted a set of proposals favorable to their demands and returned to work.

        "description": "On this day in 1972, inmates at a Washington, D.C. jail seized control of part of their prison, taking hostages and demanding to be released.\n\nThe uprising began when an inmate, pretending to have a seizure, drew a loaded .38 pistol on the two officers that came to check on him. After subduing the officers, they freed 50 other inmates and took control of the cellblock, capturing several other guards as hostages in the process.\n\nThe inmates demanded to speak to a prison reporter, Washington Claiborne. Inmates issued varying statements to him that indicated a revolutionary fervor among prisoners:\n\n\"We don't want nothin' but the sidewalk. What do you think we want, better food? Bullshit. We want the sidewalk, man.\"\n\n\"We want you to understand one thing very clearly. This is not a riot, it's a revolution.\"\n\n\"We ain't bitches, man. We don't mind dying for the fucking cause.\"\n\nPrison negotiators eventually got the inmates to back off of demanding release, but only in exchange for the opportunity to go before a federal judge to air their grievances about the jail and the promise of no reprisals for their actions. The inmates got their hearing, and a new facility was built. Despite the promise of no reprisals, all nine inmates who participated in the uprising were prosecuted and convicted on various charges.",

After a local chapter of the UMW began striking at a mine in Virden, Illinois, the Chicago-Virden Coal Company hired black strikebreakers from Birmingham, Alabama and shipped them to Virden by train.\n\nThe company hired armed detectives or security guards to accompany the strikebreakers, and an armed conflict broke out when armed miners surrounded the train as it arrived in town. A total of four detectives and seven striking mine workers were killed, with five guards, thirty miners, and an unrecorded number of strikebreakers wounded.\n\nAfter this incident, Illinois Governor John Tanner ordered the national guard to prevent any more strikebreakers from coming into the state by force. The next month, the Chicago-Virden Coal Company relented and allowed the unionization of its workers.",

Around 1930 she became a major literary figure of the \"leftist\" literature.\n\nIn 1931, her husband, communist poet Hu Yepin, was executed in Shanghai by the Kuomintang government for his association with the Communists. Shortly thereafter, she joined the Chinese Communist Party and almost all of her fiction from this time on was in support of its goals.\n\nDespite this, in 1957 she was denounced as a \"rightist\", purged from the party, and her fiction and essays were banned. She spent five years in jail during the Cultural Revolution and was sentenced to do manual labor on a farm for twelve years before being \"rehabilitated\" in 1978.",

In this role, he became a kind of \"Robin Hood\", raising money from employers under threat of reprisals, liberating prisoners, destroying property deeds and police archives, and burning villas of the rich.\n\nLater in life, after the Nazis began to come into power, he moved to Soviet Russia, however he became a dissident, criticizing bad conditions for the workers there. On September 15th, 1933, he died in a \"boating accident\", which is speculated to have actually been an NKVD assassination.",

A Marxist-Leninist and pan-Africanist, he was viewed by supporters as a charismatic and iconic figure of revolution and is sometimes referred to as \"Africa's Che Guevara\".\n\nSankara came into power when allies instigated a coup on his behalf in 1983. He immediately launched programs for social, ecological and economic change and renamed the country from the French colonial name Upper Volta to Burkina Faso (\"Land of Incorruptible People\"), with its people being called Burkinab\u00e9 (\"upright people\").\n\nHis administration was known for refusing all foreign aid to remain politically independent, nationalizing all land and mineral wealth, and promoting literacy, women's rights, and public health.\n\nOn this day in 1987, Sankara was assassinated by troops led by Blaise Compaor\u00e9, who assumed leadership of the state shortly after having Sankara killed. A week before his assassination, Sankara declared: \"While revolutionaries as individuals can be murdered, you cannot kill ideas\".",

Following the war, Kautsky was an outspoken critic of the Bolshevik Revolution, engaging in polemics with Vladimir Lenin, Leon Trotsky, and Joseph Stalin on the nature of the Soviet state. Towards the end of his life, he became close friends with Rosa Luxemburg.\n\nOf the USSR, he famously wrote \"Foreign tourists in Russia stand in silent amazement before the gigantic enterprises created there, as they stand before the pyramids, for example.

Hoxha is also known for having sharp ideological and political disagreements with the Soviet Union and communist Yugoslavia, siding most strongly with and receiving aid from Maoist China.\n\nBefore coming into power, Hoxha was a French school teacher and librarian, becoming a communist partisan after fascist Italy invaded Albania in 1939. In March 1943, the first National Conference of the Communist Party elected Hoxha formally as First Secretary.\n\nIt was in this position as First Secretary that Hoxha became head of state after the Albanian monarchy was abolished in 1946.\n\nIn the years after Stalin's death, Hoxha grew increasingly distressed by the policies of the Soviet leadership and of Khrushchev in particular. China, too, was for its own reasons disillusioned with Soviet behavior at this time, and Hoxha found common ground with Mao Zedong's criticisms of Moscow. By 1961 Hoxha's attacks on the \"revisionist\" Soviet leadership had so infuriated Khrushchev that he elected first to terminate Moscow's economic aid to Albania and ultimately to sever diplomatic relations entirely.\n\nUnder his leadership, the Albanian literacy rate improved from 5-10% in rural areas to more 90%. Hoxha was also a proponent of women's rights, stating \"the entire party and country should hurl into the fire and break the neck of anyone who dared trample underfoot the sacred edict of the party on the defense of women's rights\". Accordingly, more than 175 times as many women attended secondary schools in 1978 than had done so in 1938.\n\nThese achievements were undercut, however, by state repression of dissidents reminiscient of the Soviet Union and a paranoid personality cult. The government denied the population access to information other than that disseminated by the government-controlled media and, at one point, one out of three Albanians had either been interrogated by the Sigurimi secret police or incarcerated in labor camps (according to the book \"Albania: A Country Study\", commissioned by the U.S. government).\n\nHoxha died in 1985, leading Ramiz Alia to succeed him as head of state. Although Albania was one of the poorest European nations at the time of his death, the country was also economically self-sufficient, carrying minimal foreign debt and boasting a trade surplus of $10 million.",

The law was finally killed in 1997, when it was declared unconstitutional in 1997.

Nearly all the mines in Colorado were closed, and the dozen still open did so using imported scab labor. For the still-operating Columbine mine, scab workers were housed in Serene, which was fortified with barbed wire on the fences and armed guards.\n\nMass rallies had been held by workers outside the Columbine mine in Serene for several weeks and, on the morning of November 21st, miners and their families were fired upon by a militia of ex-police, armed with machine guns and tear gas. Six people were killed, and the event became known as the \"Columbine Massacre\".\n\nThe owner of the Rocky Mountain Fuel Company, Josephine Roche, brought an end to the strike several weeks after the incident at Columbine by declaring that the company union was to be affiliated with the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and recognizing the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA). The backbone of IWW support in the Colorado mines was broken, and the revolutionary union went into decline.",

The Francoist government used this episode to lead a widespread crackdown on the libertarian movement, and France soon followed suit. Cerrada was exiled from the CNT for his association with these activities, but continued his work after being released from prison.\n\nOn this day in 1976, Cerrada was murdered by Ram\u00f3n Benicho Canuda, a CNT Infiltrator and French Mafioso who killed Cerrada to prevent his discovery. Canuda fled to Canada after the murder, and was never charged for the crime. Named as working for a foreign power while in Toronto, Canuda subsequently disappeared.",

While there, Bishop acquired a law degree and studied the works of Lenin, Mao Zedong, and Julius Nyerere.\n\nIn 1970, he returned to Grenada and was active politically, representing striking nurses in court and leading the \"New Jewel Movement\", which ultimately led him in power when, in 1979, the movement successfully led a coup against Eric Gairy and made Bishop the Prime Minister of Grenada.\n\nAmong Bishop's core principles were workers' rights, women's rights, and the struggle against racism and apartheid. Women were given equal pay and paid maternity leave, and sex discrimination was made illegal. Organizations to promote education, health care, youth affairs, and literacy were also established. Due to his efforts, illiteracy and unemployment greatly declined.\n\nIn 1983, power struggles within the party culminated in Bishop and seven members of his cabinet being captured and executed by forces led by Bernard Coard. After his assassination, the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) and Grenada's governor-general Paul Scoon appealed to the United States for help. Within the month, Ronald Reagan launched an invasion of Grenada.",

The bombing was blamed on Italian anarchists, and Pinelli was detained along with many other leftists, including Pietro Valpreda, who was falsely convicted and served eighteen years in prison.\n\nJust before midnight on December 15th, 1969, Pinelli fell to his death from a fourth floor window of the Milan police station. Three police officers interrogating Pinelli, including Commissioner Luigi Calabresi, were put under investigation in 1971 for his death, but legal proceedings concluded it was due to accidental causes.

The two joined together in October 1966 to create the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense, which adopted the late activist's slogan \"freedom by any means necessary\" as their own.\n\nSeale and Newton founded the group to organize the black community and express their desires and needs in order to resist the racism and classism perpetuated by the system. Seale described the Panthers as \"an organization that represents black people and many white radicals relate to this and understand that the Black Panther Party is a righteous revolutionary front against this racist decadent, capitalistic system.\"",

The pair were going as working journalists to report on the sensational developments taking place in the fledgling republic of Russia. They were in Petrograd for the October Revolution. Reed was an enthusiastic supporter of the new revolutionary socialist government, and met both Leon Trotsky and Lenin while there.\n\nHe made a trip back to America, where he vehemently defended the new Soviet Republic and was arrested three times, the last for violating the Sedition Act. After being acquitted, Reed returned to the USSR and met again with Lenin and Trotsky. He died from spotted typhus while trying to return to the United States in 1920.",

The uprising was the first major threat to Soviet control since the Red Army drove Nazi Germany from its territory at the End of World War II in Europe.\n\nThe revolt began as a student protest, which attracted thousands as they marched through central Budapest to the Hungarian Parliament building. Protesters were fired upon from within the building by the State Security Police, killing multiple students. As the news of the violence spread, disorder and violence erupted throughout the capitol.\n\nThe rebellion spread quickly and the government collapsed. Thousands of people organized militias, battling the state police and Soviet troops. Radical workers' councils wrested municipal control from the ruling Hungarian Working People's Party and demanded political change.\n\nOn November 4th, a large Soviet force invaded Budapest and other regions of the country. Over 2,500 Hungarians and 700 Soviet troops were killed in the conflict, and 200,000 Hungarians fled as refugees. Mass arrests and denunciations continued for months thereafter, and suppression of the revolution continued for decades afterward.\n\nThese Soviet actions, while strengthening control over the Eastern Bloc, alienated many Western Marxists, leading to splits and/or considerable losses of membership for communist parties in capitalist states. At the inauguration of the Third Hungarian Republic in 1989, October 23rd was declared a national holiday.",

The mob gathered after hearing that a policeman had been shot and a rancher killed by Chinese. Historian John Johnson has described this as the largest mass lynching in American history.\n\nAn estimated 17 to 20 Chinese immigrants were hanged by the mob in the course of the riot, but most had already been shot to death. At least one was mutilated when someone cut off a finger to get his diamond ring. Ten men of the mob were prosecuted and eight were convicted of manslaughter in these deaths.

The women of the march called for three things: repentance for the pain of black women caused by one another, and the restoration and resurrection of African American family and community bonds.\n\nThe march, which was organized by two Philadelphia grass roots activists, Phile Chionesu and Asia Coney, enjoyed substantial turnout despite short notice and bypassing traditional leaders and organizations that had played an important role in organizing the Million Man March in 1995, such as Rev. Jesse Jackson, Louis Farrakhan, and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).\n\nNotable speakers at the event included Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, Congresswoman Maxine Waters, Sista Souljah, Jada Pinkett Smith, Attallah and Ilyasah Shabazz, the daughters of Malcolm X, and Dr. Dorothy Height.

A hospital staff occupation started as a \"work-in\" in March of the previous year, intent on exploiting a legal loophole where, if the hospital has patients, the law mandates the hospital be funded.\n\nManagement tried to transfer staff, and threatened those who refused with sanctions and firing. The threats did not succeed, and the work-in continued beyond the scheduled closing date.\n\nOn this day in 1977, a district team of officers raided Hounslow hospital to evict occupying workers, cutting phone lines and removing patients from the facility. Beds and furniture were wrecked, the floor strewn with food, torn mattresses, sheets, and personal articles.\n\nThus, the hospital was closed by force. The raid provoked a public outcry and led directly a year-long occupation of the closed hospital. 2000 striking hospital workers picketed the Ealing, Hammersmith, and Hounslow Area Health Authority (AHA) to protest the raid and demand that the hospital be reopened. When the occupation ended, work began on redesigning the facilities into a new community hospital/health center.",

By November 4th, thousands of vehicles had been burned, three people had been killed, and more than 2800 rioters were arrested.\n\nOn November 8th, President Jacques Chirac declared a state of emergency, which was granted a three month extension a week later.

Her hometown, Arecibo, became the most unionized area of the country.\n\nIn 1908, during the FLT convention, Capetillo asked the union to approve a policy for women's suffrage, insisting that all women should have the same right to vote as men. Capetillo is considered to be one of Puerto Rico's first suffragists. Along with other labor activists, she also helped pass a minimum-wage law in the Puerto Rican Legislature.\n\nToday, Capetillo is perhaps best known for being arrested for wearing pants in public, however the charges were later dropped. In 2014, the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico honored Capetillo, along with eleven other women, with plaques in the \"La Plaza en Honor a la Mujer Puertorrique\u00f1a\" (Plaza in Honor of Puerto Rican Women).",

The incident occurred after he was pulled over by Oakland cop John Frey, who called for backup after realizing who Newton was. When a second officer arrived, shots rang out; Frey was killed, while Newton and the other officer were wounded.\n\nThe \"Free Huey!\" campaign began in December, the phrase originating out a coalition between the BPP and the Peace and Freedom Party. The trial, which began on July 15th, 1968, quickly ascended beyond the scope of Newton himself, evolving into a racially-charged political movement. Although initially convicted of voluntary manslaughter, Huey was freed after months of appeals from his lawyer, on August 5th, 1970.",

He was greatly inspired by Emma Goldman, and met her briefly after a lecture she gave in Cleveland. Czolgosz's direct inspiration to assassinate a national leader possibly came from the assassination of King Umberto I of Italy by anarchist Gaetano Bresci in 1900.\n\nOn September 6th, 1901, Czolgosz shot President William McKinley on the grounds of the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. McKinley died eight days later of gangrene caused by the wounds and was succeeded by Theodore Roosevelt in office. Czolgosz was tried and found guilty just over a month later. Before his execution, Czolgosz explained \"I killed the President because he was the enemy of the good people - the good working people...I am not sorry for my crime\".\n\nThe aftermath of the assassination saw a backlash against anarchist movements. Several anarchists, including Emma Goldman, were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the attack, and vigilantes attacked anarchist colonies and newspapers. Fear of the movement also led to government surveillance programs of anarchists, which were eventually consolidated on a federal level when the Bureau of Investigation (BOI, later to become the FBI) was formed in 1908.",

        "description": "On this day in 1831, Nat Turner, a slave preacher who was on the run after initiating a slave rebellion that August, was captured. Turner (1800 - 1831) was born and raised in Southampton County, Virginia, an area where black people outnumbered whites. He learned how to read and write at a young age and was deeply religious, eventually becoming an influential preacher in the area.\n\nIn early 1831, on the basis of religious visions, Nat Turner began preparing a slave insurrection. The rebellion began on August 21st, and rebels traveled from house to house, freeing slaves and killing many of the white people that they encountered.\n\nAt least 55 white people were killed, and the slaves killed men, women, and children. The group spared a few homes \"because Turner believed the poor white inhabitants 'thought no better of themselves than they did of negroes'\". The rebellion was put down by a combined force of local militia and three companies of artillery. The state executed 56 black people, and militias killed at least 100 more, some of whom were not involved in the rebellion.\n\nTurner went on the run, eluding capture for six weeks. On this day in 1831, a white farmer discovered him hidden among the local Nottoway people in a depression in the earth, created by a large, fallen tree that was covered with fence rails. After being tried and convicted for \"conspiring to rebel and making insurrection\", he was asked if he regretted what he had done. Turner responded \"Was Christ not crucified?\"\n\nHe was hanged on November 11th, 1831. After his death, state legislatures passed new laws prohibiting education of slaves and free black people, restricting rights of assembly and other civil liberties for free black people, and requiring white ministers to be present at all worship services.",

        "description": "The Coal Creek War was an early 1890s armed labor uprising in the southeastern United States that took place primarily in Anderson County, Tennessee. This labor conflict ignited during 1891 when coal mine owners in the Coal Creek watershed began to remove and replace their company-employed, private coal miners then on the payroll with convict laborers leased out by the Tennessee state prison system, used in this case as strikebreakers.\n\nCoal workers at the Tennessee Coal Mining Company (TCMC) went on strike on April 1st, 1891, demanding to be paid in cash, not scrip (currency only usable at company stores) and to be allowed to check the weight of their haul (they were paid by weight, but not allowed to check the company's measurement). On July 14th, armed miners surrounded the stockades where leased convicts were held and sent them by train out of the city.\n\nAfter repeated attacks on mine property and the stockades where the prisoners were being kept, it was on this day in 1891 when the miners burned the stockades to the ground and freed the hundreds of convicts being held there. On Nov. 2nd, another band attacked stockades in a different location and freed those prisoners as well. From these two events alone, at least 453 convicts were set free.\n\nThe strike was forcibly put down by state militia, ending with the arrest of hundreds of miners. All but one were either acquitted or merely fined. Tennessee ended its policy of allowing convict labor in 1892.",

The workers were mostly Kurdish and Turkish immigrants, as the food and textile industries were significant employers of immigrant workers.\n\nWorking conditions at the plant were difficult - according to the anarchist publication Black Flag, workers were putting in 60-70 hours per week with no overtime, sick, or holiday pay. The day before the strike, the factory manager had fired the elected shop steward in response workers' attempts to organize through the Transport and General Workers' Union (TGWU).\n\nWhen arriving to work the next day, workers refused to work, demanding the reinstatement of their elected representative. The boss then demanded union workers leave, and then fighting broke out. The union members then gathered outside the gate, some injured, where they were attacked by police.\n\nThe following day, the sacked workers and around 100 supporters again gathered outside the warehouse, attempting to block the access road and again clashing with police. The labor disputes continued for months. After two weeks, an Industrial Tribunal initiated by TGWU ruled that the workers had been sacked for union membership, and ordered them to return to work February 26th.\n\nDespite this apparent victory, when 35 workers returned to their jobs, they were told that their union would not be recognized and that they be forced to work from 5 in the morning until midnight. This caused another strike, however it was short-lived and ineffective; only twelve out of the original forty-two fired JJ workers returned to work on March 18th.",

Mobs entered Sikh neighbourhoods, killing Sikhs indiscriminately and destroying shops and houses. Armed crowds stopped buses and trains in and near Delhi, pulling off Sikh passengers and burning them alive. Others were dragged from their homes and hacked to death while women were gang-raped. Acid attacks also took place.\n\nIn 2011, Human Rights Watch claimed that the Indian government had \"yet to prosecute those responsible for the mass killings\", and documents exposed by Wikileaks indicate that the U.S. government was convinced of Indian National Congress' complicity in the violence. As recently as 2011, new mass graves were discovered in Haryana.",

The strike was declared illegal by the U.S. Attorney General, A. Mitchell Palmer (the same person behind the infamous Palmer raids), who invoked the Lever Act, a wartime measure that made it a crime to interfere with the production or transportation of necessities.\n\nThe law had never been used against a union before, and in fact American Federation of Labor Samuel Gompers had been promised by President Woodrow Wilson that the Lever Act would not be used to suppress labor actions.\n\nThe strike was subject to Red Scare propaganda: coal operators made false charges that Lenin and Trotsky had ordered the strike and were financing it, and some of the press repeated those claims. Others used words like \"insurrection\" and \"Bolshevik revolution\". Because of this propaganda and the Attorney General's injunction against the strike, the UMW called the strike off on November 8th.\n\nMany strikers ignored this order, however, and the strike continued for over a month, with a final agreement being reached on December 10th. Workers won a 14% wage increase and the creation of an investigatory commission to mediate the wage issue.",

Approximately 215 people were indicted under the legislation, including alleged communists, anarchists, and fascists.\n\nOn this day in 1949, the first trial of communist leaders began in Manhattan, New York. The trial, lasting ten months, was one of the longest in United States history, and took place at a fever pitch of anti-communist hysteria - the USSR tested its first nuke, communists won the Chinese Civil War, and the House of UnAmerican Activities Committee began its censorship in Hollywood, all while the trial was underway.\n\nAll eleven defendants were convicted under the Smith Act, and all five of their defense attorneys were imprisoned for contempt of court. Two were later disbarred. In the years following, more than 100 additional Communist Party USA (CPUSA) officers were convicted for violating the Smith Act, decimating the leadership of the CPUSA. The Supreme Court put an end to these types of convictions in Yates v. United States (1957), where it ruled that radical speech was protected under the 1st amendment.",

They refused to leave their cells for nineteen days, protesting against the overcrowded, racist, and brutal prison system in which they were confined.\n\nThe manifesto was overtly political, seeking an \"end to the injustice suffered by all prisoners, regardless of race, creed, or color.\" It also called the U.S. prison system \"fascist concentration camps\" and made a set of demands for prisoner's rights.\n\nAmong those demands were \"an end to political persecution, racial persecution, and the denial of prisoners, to subscribe to political papers\" and \"that inmates be allowed to form or join labour unions\".",

The demonstrations were influenced by former foreign minister Aquilino Boyd, who threatened a \"peaceful invasion\" of the American-controlled Panama Canal Zone to raise the flag of the republic there as tangible evidence of Panama's sovereignty over the territory, which had been under the control of the United States since 1903.\n\nFearful that Panamanian mobs might actually force entry into the Canal Zone, the United States put troops on the ground. Several hundred Panamanians crossed barbed-wire restraints and clashed with Canal Zone police and American soldiers.\n\nExtensive and violent disorder followed. A mob smashed the windows of the United States Information Agency library. The United States flag was torn from the ambassador's residence and trampled, and the U.S. embassy was attacked. Stones were thrown against the troops, who were dispersed by tear gas. The riots were a prequel to the deadlier and more prominent Flag Protest of 1964, which led to the Torrijos-Carter Treaties, which granted independence to the Canal Zone.",

        "description": "On this day in 2003, a wildcat strike involving two-thirds of Royal Mail workers (around 20,000 people) ended in success for the striking mailing carriers.\n\nIn August of that year, the Communication Workers Union (CWU) called for a national strike for higher wages, however the proposition we defeated in a close vote. A few months later, in late October, postal workers engaged in a wildcat strike of their own, indicating a lack of trust between union rank-and-file and leadership.\n\nThe strike began when a driver in Dartford, London was sacked and 400 co-workers engaged in a spontaneous work stoppage. Within eleven days, 20,000 to 25,000 workers were out, mostly from London and the South East. More than 16 million letters per day were piling up and, after a few days, 10,000 post boxes across London were sealed off.\n\nOn November 3rd, after the management promised that there would be no repression, sackings or local deals, the strike was resolved. On the aims of the workers and why the strike was successful, one worker commented:\n\n\"It was a defensive, but successful strike. The issue is we broke the anti strike legislation. In this case even the headquarters union official were not trying very hard to enforce the law and the local union reps were actively working against the law. We broke through the unions officials 'anti-strike' politics again, and we were successful when we did.\"",

The bombing took place in a larger context of sporadic violence against UFW workers during the Salad Bowl strike, which was the largest farm workers strike in history when it began on August 23rd of that year.\n\nThe strike was in protest against the International Brotherhood of Teamsters winning legal jurisdiction over farm workers in California (the UFW had previously organized these workers). The Salad Bowl Strike caused the price of lettuce to double practically overnight, and lettuce growers lost $500,000 a day.\n\nThe strike also led to C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez, a UFW leader, to get arrested and imprisoned. When he was visited by athlete Rafer Johnson and Ethel Kennedy, widow of slain Senator Robert F. Kennedy, Johnson and Kennedy were attacked by an anti-union mob on the steps of the jail and police had to suppress a would-be riot.\n\nAlthough the strike ended on March 26th, 1971, when the Teamsters and UFW signed a new jurisdictional agreement reaffirming the UFW's right to organize field workers, jurisdictional labor disputes (and the associated violence) would continue for years afterward. These tensions led directly to the passage of the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act in 1975.",

Debs, born on this day in 1855, was an American socialist, trade unionist, a founding member of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), and a five time presidential candidate of the Socialist Party of America. Through his presidential candidacies as well as his work with labor movements, Debs eventually became one of the best-known socialists living in the United States.\n\nWhile in prison for leading the Pullman Strike, Debs read various works of socialist theory and emerged six months later as a committed adherent of the international socialist movement. Debs was a founding member of the Social Democracy of America (1897), the Social Democratic Party of America (1898) and the Socialist Party of America (1901). Debs ran as a Socialist candidate for President of the United States five times, including 1900 (earning 0.6% of the popular vote), 1904 (3.0%), 1908 (2.8%), 1912 (6.0%) and 1920 (3.4%), the last time from a prison cell. He was also a candidate for United States Congress from his native state Indiana in 1916.\n\nDebs was noted for his oratory, and his speech denouncing American participation in World War I led to his second arrest in 1918. He was convicted under the Sedition Act of 1918 and sentenced to a term of 10 years. In his speech to the court, he provided one of his most well-known quotes:\n\n\"Your Honor, years ago I recognized my kinship with all living beings, and I made up my mind that I was not one bit better than the meanest on earth. I said then, and I say now, that while there is a lower class, I am in it, and while there is a criminal element, I am of it, and while there is a soul in prison, I am not free.\"",

It served as the county seat and headquarters of the Chinese Soviet government.\n\nOn this day in 1931, with the Soviet Union's help, the \"Chinese Soviet Republic\" was born, though the majority of China was still under the control of the nationalist Government of the Republic of China. On November 7th, they had an open ceremony for the new country, and Mao Zedong and other Communists attended a military parade. Claiming its own bank, printing its own money, and collecting tax through its own tax bureau, the modern Chinese Communist Party considers this the beginning of Two Chinas.\n\nThe Jiangxi-Fujian base area was defended ably by the First Red Front Army but in 1934 it was finally overrun by the Kuomintang government's National Revolutionary Army in the Fifth of its Encirclement Campaigns. This last campaign in 1934-35 precipitated the most famous of the communist army retreats known collectively as the \"Long March\".",

The name \"October Revolution\" comes from the fact that the revolution began on October 25th in the dating convention of the time.\n\nLed by the Bolshevik Party of Vladimir Lenin, the revolution took place through an armed insurrection in Petrograd and was instrumental in the larger Russian Revolution of 1917 - 1923. By the following day, the Winter Palace (the seat of the Provisional government located in Petrograd, then capitol of Russia) was captured.\n\nElections were held on November 12th. In contrast to their majority in the Soviets (local council governments), the Bolsheviks only won 175 seats in the 715-seat legislative body, coming in second behind the Socialist Revolutionary Party, which won 370 seats. On its first and only day in session, the Constituent Assembly came into conflict with the Soviets, and it rejected Soviet decrees on peace and land, resulting in the Constituent Assembly being dissolved by the Bolsheviks in January.\n\nThe political situation devolved into a civil war between the Bolsheviks, the Whites (counter-revolutionaries), Makhnovists, independence movements, and other socialist factions. Eventually, the Bolsheviks defeated all rival parties militarily and formed the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) in 1922. Their victory marked the beginning of Marxism-Leninism as a global force.",

Trotsky became more prominent from March 1918 to January 1925 as the leader of the Red Army in the post of Commissar for Military and Naval Affairs. He was also a vital leading figure in the Red victory in the Russian Civil War and one of the seven members of the first Politburo.\n\nAfter the rise of Joseph Stalin, Trotsky was removed from his positions and eventually expelled from the Soviet Union in February 1929. He spent the rest of his life in exile, and was assassinated in 1940 in Mexico City by Ram\u00f3n Mercader, a Soviet agent.",

Makhno was the commander of the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine, commonly referred to as the Makhnovshchina (loosely translated as \"Makhno movement\"). The Makhnovshchina was a predominantly peasant phenomenon that grew into a mass social movement.\n\nMakhno and his supporters attempted to reorganize social and economic life along anarchist principles, including the establishment of communes on former landed estates, the requisition and egalitarian redistribution of land to the peasants, and the organization of free elections to local soviets (councils) and regional congresses.\n\nAlthough Makhno considered the Bolsheviks a threat to the development of an anarchist Free Territory within Ukraine, he entered into formal military alliances twice with the Red Army to defeat the White Army. In the aftermath of the White Army's defeat in Crimea in November 1920, the Bolsheviks initiated a military campaign against Makhno. After an extended period of open resistance against the Red Army, Makhno fled across the Romanian border in August 1921.\n\nIn exile, Makhno settled in Paris with his wife Halyna and daughter Yelena. While there, Makhno wrote numerous memoirs and articles for radical newspapers before dying there at the age of 45 from tuberculosis-related causes.",

Though 556 people were deported, including many prominent leftist leaders like Emma Goldman, Palmer's efforts were largely frustrated by officials at the U.S. Department of Labor, which had authority for deportations and objected to methods.\n\nDuring the first raid on November 7th, agents of the Bureau of Investigation working with local police executed a series of well-publicized and violent raids against the Union of Russian Workers in twelve cities. Newspaper accounts reported some were \"badly beaten\" during the arrests. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) was founded in direct response to this xenophobic and political persecution.",

The New Orleans Board of Trade announced it would sign contracts agreeing to the terms - but only with the white unions, however this offer was steadfastly refused.\n\nEventually, other union leaders in the city began calling for a strike in support of the Triple Alliance, and, on this day in 1892, a multi-racial coalition of 25,000 workers across the entire city went on strike. Efforts by the city to find strikebreaking workers, both from within and outside of New Orleans, failed.\n\nAfter just three days, the Board of Trade agreed to binding arbitration to settle the strike, with employers agreeing to sit down with both white and black union leaders. After 48 hours of negotiations, the employers agreed to the 10-hour day and overtime pay for the Triple Alliance workers. Members of other unions also won reduced hours and higher pay.",

She was perhaps the best-known political radical in the American Catholic Church and co-founded the Catholic Worker movement with her partner Peter Maurin.\n\nThe Catholic Worker movement started when the first issue of the Catholic Worker appeared on May 1st, 1933, priced at one cent, and published continuously since then. It was aimed at those suffering the most in the depths of the Great Depression, \"those who think there is no hope for the future\", and announced to them that \"the Catholic Church has a social program...there are men of God who are working not only for their spiritual but for their material welfare.\" It accepted no advertising and did not pay its staff.\n\nLike many newspapers of the day, including those for which Day had been writing, it was an unapologetic example of advocacy journalism. It provided coverage of strikes, explored working conditions, especially of women and black workers, and explicated papal teaching on social issues. Its viewpoint was partisan and stories were designed to move its readers to take action locally, for example, by patronizing laundries recommended by the Laundry Workers' Union. Its advocacy of federal child labor laws put it at odds with the American Church hierarchy from its first issue.\n\nDay's activism continued throughout the rest of her life, resulting in multiple arrests. In the summer of 1973, she joined C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez in his campaign for farm laborers in the fields of California and was arrested at the age of 75 for defying an injunction against picketing, spending ten days in jail.",

The name Kristallnacht (\"Crystal Night\") comes from the shards of broken glass that littered the streets after the windows of Jewish-owned stores, buildings and synagogues were smashed.\n\nThe pretext for the attacks was the assassination of the German diplomat Ernst vom Rath by Herschel Grynszpan, a 17-year-old German-born Polish Jew, after Grynszpan learned that his parents from Germany to the Polish frontier. Within hours of Rath's death, the Kristallnacht was launched against Jewish communities in Germany.\n\nJewish homes, hospitals and schools were ransacked as attackers demolished buildings with sledgehammers. Rioters destroyed 267 synagogues throughout Germany, Austria, and the Sudetenland. Over 7,000 Jewish businesses were damaged or destroyed, and 30,000 Jewish men were arrested and incarcerated in concentration camps. Estimates of the amount of people killed vary from 91 to as high as 638. Historians view Kristallnacht as a prelude to the Final Solution and the murder of six million Jews during the Holocaust.",

In the aftermath, approximately four hundred people were arrested and seventy-five were badly injured, included many police officers. The event is known as \"Bloody Sunday\".\n\nThe demonstration was organized by the Social Democratic Federation, Britain's first formally socialist party, and the Irish National League, an Irish nationalist organization. On November 13th, 1887, at least 10,000 protesters marched in to Trafalgar Square from several different directions, led by leaders of the Social Democratic Federation. Members of the Fabian Society were also present, including playwright George Bernard Shaw and Eleanor Marx.\n\nTwo thousand police and 400 troops were deployed to halt the demonstration and protesters, many armed with \"iron bars, knives, pokers and gas pipes\", fought back. John Burns and Robert Cunninghame-Graham, Social Democratic Federation leaders, were arrested and imprisoned for six weeks. The following Sunday, there was another demonstration and more casualties.",

Set up in Manchester, its policy of \"deeds not words\" led to militant methods of campaigning by women frustrated by the failure of more peaceful methods. Members of the group committed many illegal activities, ranging from slapping policemen to widespread arson attacks.\n\nAlthough Garnett was arrested for assaulting Churchill, she was only charged with disturbing the peace because Churchill did not want to appear in court. She served one month in Horfield Prison.",

        "description": "Karen Gay Silkwood (1946 - 1974) was an American chemical technician and labor union activist who was possibly assassinated on this day in 1974. Silkwood is most known for raising concerns about corporate practices related to health and safety in the Kerr-McGee Cimarron Fuel Fabrication Site in Oklahoma.\n\nAs an employee of Kerr-Mcgee, Silkwood made plutonium pellets and was the first woman on the union's negotiating team. After investigating her workplace, she found several health code violations and later testified to the Atomic Energy Commission about her concerns for the handling of radioactive materials at work. Shortly before her death, Silkwood's body contained 400 times the legal limit of plutonium.\n\nOn this day in 1974, while en route to meet a New York Times journalist and union official, Silkwood died in a crash where her car ran off the road. She had just left a union meeting at the Hub cafe in Crescent and was seen with a binder full of documents. None of the documents were found at the scene of the crash.\n\nAlthough foul play was not conclusively proven, skid marks from Silkwood's car were present on the road, suggesting that she was trying to get back onto the road after being pushed from behind. Investigators also noted damage on the rear of Silkwood's vehicle that was not present before the accident, and microscopic examination of the rear of Silkwood's car showed paint chips that could have come only from a rear impact by another vehicle.\n\nSilkwood's family sued Kerr-McGee on grounds of negligence, and Kerr-McGee eventually settled out of court for $1.38 million, admitting no liability. Kerr-McGee closed its nuclear fuel plants in 1975.",

The occupying students demanded the restoration of democracy in Greece, and were shot at by government snipers set up around the building. On November 17th, the state finally broke through erected barricades by sending a tank crashing through the gates of the Polytechnic.\n\nAlthough the state claimed no students were killed, there were at least 24 recorded deaths, and many estimates are much higher.

Beal was convicted and skipped bail, fleeing to the Soviet Union. There, he became ambivalent about the state of the Bolshevik revolution and sought to return to the United States.\n\nAfter successfully fleeing to his home country, Beal changed his mind once more, returning to the Soviet Union and working as a manager in a Ukrainian tractor factory. It was here that he became disillusioned for good with the communist system, noting bitterly that he was still a labor organizer, facing Soviet versions of the same issues that had prompted the North Carolinians to strike, only now he was urging workers not to demand better conditions.\n\nUpon returning to the U.S., he became an anti-communist critic, publishing his experiences in a book titled \"Proletarian Journey\". After serving four years in prison, he was paroled and began working at a textile mill, participating in union activities there. He died on November 15th, 1954, of a heart attack.",

Trolley and public utility workers initiated the labor action, inspired by a successful railroad workers' strike in nearby Dur\u00e1n.

On November 15th, 1922, more than 20,000 demonstrators gathered in downtown Guayaquil and marched towards the police station. When they arrived, they were fired upon by soldiers at the station. Approximately three hundred protesters died, either by gunshot or from being stabbed by bayonets. For most workers, this incident was the end of the strike, however many of their demands, including an exchange rate moratorium and wage increases for trolley workers, were conceded.",

Myansikov participated in the Revolution of 1905 and became an underground Bolshevik activist in 1906. He was arrested by Tsarist police and spent over seven years at hard labor in Siberia.\n\nIn 1922, along with former members of the Workers' Opposition (a dissident group with the Bolsheviks), Myasnikov signed the \"Letter of the Twenty-Two\", sent to the Comintern in 1922, protesting the Russian Communist Party leaders' suppression of dissent among proletarian members of the Communist Party. Shortly thereafter, Myasnikov was expelled from the Russian Communist Party, and he formed an opposition faction called \"Workers Group of the Russian Communist Party\" that opposed the New Economic Policy (NEP).\n\nMyasnikov was arrested by the Soviet state in 1923, and served several years in prison before being exiled to Armenia, where he fled the country. In 1944, he accepted an invitation by the Soviet embassy in France to return to the USSR. Upon his arrival, he was arrested by the Soviet secret police and later executed on November 16th, 1945.",

The Jesuits were deemed \"subversives\" that needed to be eliminated, and officers attempted to disguise the operation as a rebel attack, using an AK-47 rifle that had been captured from the FMLN.\n\nAfter storming their residence and killing the priests, soldiers also executed housekeeper Julia Elba Ramos and her 16-year-old daughter, Celina Mariceth Ramos. The murders increased international pressure for a cease-fire and became one of the key turning points that led toward a negotiated settlement to the war.",

Harry Moore also advocated for better housing and education, as well as investigating lynchings, filing lawsuits against voter registration barriers, and fighting for equal pay for black teachers in public schools. In 1946, Harriette Moore and her husband were both fired by the Brevard County public school system and blacklisted due to their political activities.\n\nOn their 25th wedding anniversary (December 25th, 1951), their home in Mims, Florida was bombed. The local hospital would not treat black people, and Harry died on the way to the nearest one that would, 30 miles away in Sanford, Florida. Harriette died from her wounds nine days later, on January 3rd, 1952, at the same hospital. Their deaths were two of the earliest assassinations in the civil rights movement.\n\nAlthough the Federal Bureau of Investigation investigated their murders, no one was ever prosecuted. A state investigation and forensic work in 2005 identified four Ku Klux Klan members who likely committed the bombing, however they had all been dead for many years.",

Taft's administration had close relations with U.S. corporations operating in Nicaragua. Those corporations were opposed to the way Zelaya defended the economic interests of his country and the region from exploitation by U.S. businesses.\n\nThe U.S. moved to remove President Zelaya after he executed two American citizens who had conspired to commit a revolution against the government. Despite the fact that Zelaya proposed a commission made up of Mexicans and Americans come to Nicaragua to investigate the executions, promising to resign if it found him guilty of any wrongdoing, President Taft ordered warships to approach both Nicaraguan coasts and marines to assemble in Panama.\n\nZelaya fled the country, stating that he would \"give no pretext\" to American hostilities. His successor Jos\u00e9 Madr\u00edz was eventually forced to resign by the American forces, and followed Zelaya into exile. Historian Stephen Kinzer has written the following about event:\n\n\"This was the first time the United States government had explicitly orchestrated the overthrow of a foreign leader. In Hawaii, an American diplomat had managed the revolution, but without specific instructions from Washington. In Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines, American 'regime change' operations were part of a larger war. The overthrow of President Zelaya in Nicaragua was the first real American coup.\"",

Morrison, a Salt Lake City area grocer and former policeman, and his son were shot and killed by two men. The same evening, Hill arrived at a doctor's office with a gunshot wound, and briefly mentioned a fight over a woman.\n\nHe refused to explain further, even after he was accused of the grocery store murders on the basis of his injury. Hill was convicted of the murders in a controversial trial and executed on this day in 1915, despite widespread calls for clemency, including from President Woodrow Wilson and Helen Keller.\n\nAfter his arrest, Hill wrote the following about his case: \"Owing to the prominence of Mr. Morrison, there had to be a 'goat' [scapegoat] and the undersigned being, as they thought, a friendless tramp, a Swede, and worst of all, an IWW, had no right to live anyway, and was therefore duly selected to be 'the goat'.\"",

Hayling, born on this day in 1929, has been hailed as the \"father\" of St. Augustine's civil rights movement and was a staunch advocate of armed self-defense within the black community. He organized demonstrations and coordinated visiting activists, including Dr. Martin Luther King.\n\nDr. Hayling brought direct action to the local chapter of the NAACP by organizing young people into a youth council within the organization. At his dental office, Dr. Hayling taught them methods of nonviolent activism. He arranged picketing and sit-ins at white-only restaurants, and wade-ins at a white-only pool and beach, and was arrested many times for his activism, as well as being assaulted by the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nAs he gained a reputation for militance, Hayling was threatened with the revocation of his local NAACP chapter's charter by Executive Secretary Roy Wilkins. Hayling replied, \"I will mail you your charter\", and vowed to continue his activities without the support of the NAACP.\n\nDr. Hayling is also remembered for this quote: \"I and the others have armed. We will shoot first and answer questions later. We are not going to die like Medgar Evers.\" Dr. Hayling died in 2015, at the age of 86.",

Nearly all the mines in Colorado were closed, and the dozen still open did so using imported scab labor. For the still-operating Columbine mine, scab workers were housed in Serene, which was fortified with barbed wire on the fences and armed guards.\n\nMass rallies had been held by miners outside the Columbine mine in Serene for several weeks and, on this day in 1927, a crowd of more than five hundred workers was fired on by an ex-cop militia. The militia was armed with machine pistols, rifles, riot guns and tear gas grenades.\n\nThe workers were fired upon after a dispute on whether or not they could enter the town of Serene. The event is known as the Columbine Massacre; six people were killed, all miners. No member of the militia was ever held accountable for the violence of that day.",

He was the lover and lifelong friend of anarchist Emma Goldman. In 1892, undertaking an act of propaganda of the deed, Berkman made an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate businessman Henry Clay Frick, for which he served 14 years in prison.\n\nOn their release from prison (for conspiring against the draft), Berkman and Goldman were arrested and deported to Russia. Initially supportive of the Bolshevik revolution, Berkman and Goldman soon became disillusioned, voicing their opposition to the Soviets' use of terror after seizing power and their repression of fellow revolutionaries.\n\nAmong Berkman's most notable works are \"Prison Memoirs of an Anarchist\" (1912), an account of his 14 years in prison after attempting to assassinate Frick; \"The Bolshevik Myth\" (1925), describing his experiences in Bolshevist Russia from 1920 to 1922; \"Now and After: The ABC of Communist Anarchism\" (1929), which anarchist Stuart Christie called \"among the best introductions to the ideas of anarchism in the English language\".",

To offset labor demands for better wages, local police would arrest black men nightly for minor crimes and force them to work in the mill at gunpoint.\n\nIn response to the attempted unionizing efforts, the company organized racist whites into the SPLL. Company gunmen and the SPLL assaulted union members, evicted them from company housing, burned private homes, kidnapped, and tortured organizers.\n\nOn November 21st, they shot up black labor organizer Sol Dacus's home. In a show of force the next day, Dacus marched through the town accompanied by white supporters and allies in the labor movement. The SPLL then murdered four of those white allies, including one American Federation of Labor (AFL) district representative. Dacus and his family were able to escape to New Orleans.\n\nThis incident was part of a larger period of civil unrest known as the American Red Summer of 1919, including massacres and riots in Elaine, Arkansas, Chicago, Washington D.C., Knoxville, Tennessee, Wilmington, Delaware, and other cities.",

He drew inspiration from the Mexican and the Russian revolutions, the struggle in Ireland and Sandino's guerrilla movement in Nicaragua. He shared the anti-imperialist politics of the age and, drawing on anarchist roots, advocated rural and urban armed struggle, assaults on army barracks and the assassination of policemen and members of the government.\n\nHe was a firm believer in direct action, the propaganda of the deed, derived from Blanqui and the Spanish anarchists, and was much criticised by the Communists for his voluntarism and his predilection for violence.\"\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Guiteras died in a firefight while trying to flee the country.",

The violence at union rallies during the strike prompted Larkin to call for a workers' militia to be formed to protect themselves against the police. For the duration of the lock-out was armed with hurleys and bats to protect workers' demonstrations from the police.\n\nIn 1916, it took part in the Easter Rising, an armed insurrection aimed at ending British rule in Ireland. Despite the relatively small size of the army, it was more organized than the larger Irish Volunteers, with its members receiving superior training and being less affected by factional and ideological division.

The sugar cane workers, determined to unionize for a living wage, had chosen to strike during the crucial harvest season, during which there was a narrow window of time to harvest the cane and the planters would be unlikely to find strikebreakers.\n\nJudge Taylor Beattie, an ex-Confederate soldier and slaveowner, declared martial law and gathered up hundreds of white men to form a paramilitary group to suppress the strikers, close the borders to the city, and monitor all movement of black people in the area. Not wanting to be boxed in, black strikers fired on the city border guards. In retaliation, the paramilitary forces initiated three days of violence against mostly unarmed black workers and their families.\n\nEstimates of the total number of dead range from 35-60, making it one of the deadliest strikes in American labor history. Despite the women and children killed, the Southern press heralded the white perpetrators of the violence. One participant, Andrew Price, went on to be elected to Congress. Black farmworkers did not make a large effort to unionize again until the 1940s.",

It was the largest strike by female American workers up to that date and was led by Clara Lemlich and the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, also supported by the National Women's Trade Union League of America (NWTUL).\n\nThe industry working conditions preceding the strike were atrocious - work weeks of 65 hours were normal, and in season they might expand to as many as 75 hours. Despite low wages, workers were often required to buy their own materials, including needles, thread, and sewing machines.\n\nIn February of 1910, the NWTUL settled with the factory owners, gaining improved wages, working conditions, and hours. The end of the strike was followed just a year later by the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire, which exposed the plight of immigrant women working in dangerous and difficult conditions and boosted participation in the garment unions.",

One the four sisters - Patria, Minerva, Mar\u00eda Teresa, and Ded\u00e9 - only Ded\u00e9 survived, dying of natural causes in 2014.\n\nTo organize against the state, Minerva, Mar\u00eda Teresa, and Patria began distributing pamphlets about the many people whom Trujillo had killed, and obtained materials for guns and bombs for use when they eventually openly revolted. The sisters called themselves \"Las Mariposas\" (\"The Butterflies\"), after Minerva's underground name. For their acts of subversion, Mar\u00eda, Minerva, both of their husbands, and Patria's husband were all imprisoned.\n\nAfter being freed, Patria, Minerva, Mar\u00eda Teresa, and their driver, Rufino de la Cruz were attacked after visiting Mar\u00eda's and Minerva's incarcerated husbands. On the way home, the sisters and de la Cruz were separated, strangled, and clubbed to death. The bodies were then gathered and put in their Jeep, which was run off the mountain road in an attempt to make their deaths look like an accident.\n\nThe assassinations turned the Mirabal sisters into \"symbols of both popular and feminist resistance\", according to the New York Times. In their honor, the United Nations General Assembly designated the 25th of November as \"International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women\" in 1999.",

In 1917, he hailed the Russian Revolution as the beginning of that global revolution and had correspondence with Lenin on multiple occasions, wishing him well and asking for his support in condemning Dutch social democrats for not condemning American imperialism. Lenin sent Gorter a copy of \"State and Revolution\" in response, which Gorter then offered to translate.",

The Free Territory was an attempt to form a stateless anarchist society during the Ukrainian Revolution of 1917 to 1921. It existed from 1918 to 1921, during which time \"free soviets\" and libertarian communes operated under the protection of Nestor Makhno's Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army (flag shown above).\n\nAs Makhnovia self-organized along anarchist principles, references to \"control\" and \"government\" are highly contentious. For example, the Makhnovists, often cited as a form of government (with Nestor Makhno as their \"leader\"), played a purely military role, with Makhno himself functioning as little more than a military strategist and advisor. The economy of Makhnovia was market socialist and anarcho-communist in character (depending on the region) - where money was used, production was organized in the form of worker cooperatives.\n\nThe Bolsheviks were openly hostile to the Free Territory. On November 26th, 1920, less than two weeks after the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army assisted Bolshevik forces in defeating the White Army, Makhno's headquarters staff and many of his subordinate commanders were arrested at a Red Army planning conference to which they had been invited by Moscow, and executed. Nestor Makhno fled the region several months later, settling in Paris, France.",

Milk unsuccessfully ran for office three times, but finally won a seat as a city supervisor in 1977.\n\nMilk was assassinated on this day in 1978, after only eleven months in office.

His father owned large textile factories in Barmen and Salford, England. His revolutionary predilections (and later, his atheistic beliefs) put him at odds with his family, who expected Engels to inherit the family business.\n\nEngels' career became intertwined with Marx's when he began writing articles for \"Rheinische Zeitung\", a German newspaper that Karl Marx edited. In 1845, Engels published \"The Condition of the Working Class in England\", based on personal observations and research of poverty and disease in English cities. In 1848, Engels co-authored the \"Communist Manifesto\" with Marx.\n\nLater, Engels supported Marx financially, allowing him to perform research and write \"Das Kapital\". After Marx's death, Engels edited the second and third volumes of \"Das Kapital\". Additionally, Engels organized Marx's notes into \"Theories of Surplus Value\", which were later published as the fourth volume of \"Das Kapital\". In 1884, he published \"The Origin of the Family\", Private Property and the State\", based on Marx's ethnographic research.",

        "description": "Faye Schulman, born on this day in 1919, was a Jewish partisan and photographer who took up arms against the Nazis who were responsible for killing her family.\n\nOn August 14th, 1942, the Germans killed 1,850 Jews from the \"Lenin\" ghetto (named after Lenin, Poland, where Faye was from), including her parents, sisters, and younger brother. Faye was spared for her ability to develop photographs, and the Nazis ordered Faye to develop their photographs of the massacre. Later, she cited taking a photo of her dead family in a mass grave as the impetus to take up arms.\n\nDuring a partisan raid on the camp, Faye fled to the forests and joined the Molotava Brigade, a partisan group mostly comprised of escaped Soviet Red Army POWs. She was accepted because her brother-in-law had been a doctor and they were desperate for anyone who knew anything about medicine. Faye served the group as a nurse from September 1942 to July 1944, even though she had no previous medical experience.\n\nDuring another raid on the Lenin ghetto, Faye succeeded in recovering her old photographic equipment. During the next two years, she took over a hundred photographs, developing the medium format negatives under blankets and making \"sun prints\" during the day. While on missions, Faye buried the camera and tripod to keep it safe. Schulman is the only known Jewish partisan photographer from this era.\n\n\"I want people to know that there was resistance. Jews did not go like sheep to the slaughter. I was a photographer. I have pictures. I have proof.\" - Faye Schulman",

        "description": "The Sand Creek Massacre was a massacre of Cheyenne and Arapaho people by the U.S. Army that occurred on this day in 1864, as part of the First Nations Wars.\n\nIt began when a 675-man force of the Third Colorado Cavalry attacked and destroyed a village of Cheyenne and Arapaho people in southeastern Colorado Territory, killing and mutilating hundreds of indigenous people, about two-thirds of whom were women and children. This violence took place despite the fact that Black Kettle, a chief known for choosing policies of peace with the colonizers, was flying an American flag and white flag over his lodge to forestall any possible attack.\n\nTwo officers of the attacking forces, Captain Silas Soule and Lieutenant Joseph Cramer refused to obey the order to attack the camp. The rest of the soldiers charged however, killing all present, regardless of age. The soldiers killed children and took trophies, cutting off the fingers, ears, noses, and testicles of the fallen as keepsakes.\n\nChief Ochinee (One-Eye) managed to escape from the camp, but, seeing the massacre unfolding, returned to die with his people. A survivor of the massacre, a 24-year old indigenous woman named Mochni, became a warrior afterward, and participated in raids against colonizers until her incarceration and death. Many others, who had previously supported peace, joined the Dog Soldiers, an indigenous group that engaged against guerilla warfare against the state and would-be settlers on their land.",

        "description": "The Seattle WTO protests, sometimes referred to as the Battle of Seattle, were a series of large anti-globalization protests that began on this day in 1999. Protesters surrounded the WTO Ministerial Conference, which was to be the launch of a new millennial round of trade negotiations. The negotiations were quickly overshadowed by the massive street protests outside the hotels and the Washington State Convention and Trade Center, estimated to have more than 40,000 participants.\n\nThe protests were a mix of permitted rallies and marches (involving the ALF-CIO) and direct action from anarchists and other political radicals. By noon, the opening ceremony of the conference had been canceled due to protest control and vandalism of intersections downtown, and that night the mayor declared a state of emergency. Police began gassing and arresting people indiscriminately, sometimes targeting bystanders who weren't participating in the protests. By December 1st, 500 people had been jailed.\n\nTo many in North American anarchist and radical circles, the Seattle WTO riots, protests, and demonstrations were viewed as a success - prior to the \"Battle of Seattle\", almost no mention was made of \"anti-globalization\" in the US media, while the protests were seen as having forced the media to report on 'why' anybody would oppose the WTO. Controversy over the city's response to the protests resulted in the resignation of the police chief of Seattle, Norm Stamper.",

        "description": "Samuel Clemens, better known by his pen name Mark Twain, was an American writer, humorist, and anti-imperialist born on this day in 1835. He was lauded as the \"greatest humorist [the United States] has produced\", and William Faulkner called him \"the father of American literature\". After 1899, he was also a committed anti-imperialist and anti-racist.\n\nBefore 1899, however, he supported imperialism, calling the Spanish War \"the worthiest\" war the U.S. ever fought. In the New York Herald, he described his anti-imperialism epiphany like this:\n\n\"I wanted the American eagle to go screaming into the Pacific ... Why not spread its wings over the Philippines, I asked myself? ... I said to myself, Here are a people who have suffered for three centuries. We can make them as free as ourselves, give them a government and country of their own, put a miniature of the American Constitution afloat in the Pacific, start a brand new republic to take its place among the free nations of the world. It seemed to me a great task to which we had addressed ourselves.\"\n\n\"But I have thought some more, since then, and I have read carefully the treaty of Paris [which ended the Spanish-American War], and I have seen that we do not intend to free, but to subjugate the people of the Philippines. We have gone there to conquer, not to redeem.\"\n\nFrom 1901 until his death in 1910, Twain was vice-president of the American Anti-Imperialist League, which believed that there is a fundamental contradiction between the ideas upon which the American republic was founded and designs for colonial expansion being advanced by the nation's contemporary political leaders.",

As early as 1943, Parks exited the bus rather than to give up her seat but continue riding. Parks said, \"My resisting being mistreated on the bus did not begin with that particular arrest. I did a lot of walking in Montgomery.\"\n\nThe National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), for whom Parks worked as a secretary, believed that she was the best candidate for seeing through a court challenge because she was perceived as a responsible, mature woman with a good reputation. Accordingly, the NAACP bailed her out of jail after her arrest.\n\nDue to economic sanctions used against activists, Parks lost her job at the department store, and her husband quit his job after his boss forbade him to talk about his wife or her legal case. Parks was convicted in a local trial within a week of her arrest, and the appeals process was greatly slowed by the state government of Alabama. From the economic pressure of the Montgomery Bus Boycott, eventually the city conceded and reversed its segregation bus laws.",

Although they were ostensibly missionaries, the nuns were also political radicals, with Maura Clarke having supported the Sandinistas in Nicaragua.\n\nAlthough thousands of native Salvadorans had already been murdered by death squads there, the killing of these missionaries prompted international outrage and criticism of President Carter's support for the government in El Salvador. Although Carter initially suspended aid to the regime, he later reinstated it and President Reagan continued this support.\n\nAfter the release of declassified documents in the 1990s, New Jersey congressman Robert Torricelli stated that it was \"now clear that while the Reagan Administration was certifying human rights progress in El Salvador they knew the terrible truth that the Salvadoran military was engaged in a widespread campaign of terror and torture\".",

        "description": "On this day in 1984, the Bhopal Disaster was one the world's worst industrial catastrophes, took place when a gas leak exposed more than 500,000 people to highly toxic methyl isocyanate gas. Estimates of those killed range widely, from 3,900 - 16,000 people dying as a result of the exposure, with tens of thousnads injured.\n\nThe leak took place at the Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL) pesticide plant in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India. Multiple leaks and worker exposures to toxic chemicals had taken place in the years leading up to the Bhopal Disaster, leading journalist Rajkumar Keswani to state \"Wake up, people of Bhopal, you are on the edge of a volcano\".\n\nThe mass leak of methl isocyanate gas (MIC) was caused by widespread neglect of infrastructure and safety measures for storing the chemical. Thousands of people had died by the following morning, generally from choking, reflexogenic circulatory collapse, and/or pulmonary oedema. MIC gas is also approximately twice as dense as air, leading to children inhaling significantly greater concentrations of the toxin. The stillbirth rate increased by up to 300% and the neonatal mortality rate by around 200%.\n\nLacking any safe alternative, on December 16th, tanks 611 and 619 were emptied of the remaining MIC by reactivating the plant and continuing the manufacture of pesticide, leading to a second mass evacuation from Bhopal.\n\nIn 1991, the local Bhopal authorities charged Warren Anderson, former Union Carbide Corporation CEO who had retired in 1986, with manslaughter (UCIL was majority-owned by UCC). Anderson was declared a fugitive from justice on February 1st, 1992 for failing to appear at the subsequent court hearings. The U.S. government declined to extradite him, and the Supreme Court ruled that victims of the Bhopal disaster could not seek damages in a U.S. court.\n\nIn June 2010, seven former employees of UCIL, all Indian nationals and many in their 70s, were convicted of causing death by negligence.",

Among the many accounts of the violence, N. Farmakis, a teenaged member of the Anti-EAM \"Organization X\" testified that he saw the head of the police Angelos Evert giving the order to open fire on the crowd by means of a handkerchief waved from the window.\n\nThe massacre marked the beginning of the \"Dekemvriana\" (\"December Events\" in English), a period of fighting between the EAM and the British Army and its collaborators. The Dekemvriana broke the power of the EAM, with 13,000 members of the EAM arrested and transferred by the British to concentration camps. The massacre and its aftermath were important events in the lead up to the Greek Civil War of 1946.",

        "description": "On this day in 1854, a battle between Australian miners and British Colonial Authorities broke out at a makeshift stockade that the miners constructed, a working class revolt that killed dozens and led to democratic reforms in 1856.\n\nThe battle followed months of negotiations and civil unrest by miners, who wanted to loosen restrictions and the price on mining licenses. Colonial police would brutally enforce restrictive licensing laws by patrolling mines and harassing workers, pejoratively dubbed \"license hunts\".\n\nAs tensions between the miners and government increased, a militant labor leader, Peter Lalor, was elected. Lalor quickly organized the miners into a militaristic structure, with rebel brigades that would elect their captains.\n\nThe miners then set up an encampment and barricaded an area known as Bakery Hill to protect themselves from colonial officals and license Hunts. There, they raised the \"Eureka Flag\", a blue flag with a white Southern Cross with a deliberately absent Union Jack, the first ever flag to represent a Republican Australia.\n\nOn the early morning of December 3rd, 276 soldiers and policemen attacked the camp. The battle was short and a decisive victory for the government: 22-60 miners were killed and over 100 were captured, while only 6 soldiers were killed.\n\nThirteen leaders of the miners were placed on trial for treason. After an outpouring of popular support, the miners were freed and carried through the streets of Melbourne as heroes. This support contributed to the passage of male suffrage in 1856, one of the earliest democratic reforms in Australian history.",

In this capacity, he founded the Rainbow Coalition, a multi-racial class-conscious organization that initially included the Black Panthers, the Young Patriots, and the Young Lords, as well as an alliance among major Chicago street gangs to help them work for social change rather than fight amongst each other.\n\nIn 1967, Hampton was identified by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) as a radical threat. The FBI tried to subvert his activities in Chicago, sowing disinformation among these groups and placing a counterintelligence operative in the local Panthers.\n\nOn December 4th, 1969, Hampton was assassinated in his bed during a predawn raid at his Chicago apartment by a tactical unit of the Cook County State's Attorney's Office, in conjunction with the Chicago Police Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. During the raid, another Panther, Mark Clark, was killed and several more were seriously wounded.\n\nAt a press conference the next day, the police announced the arrest team had been attacked by the \"violent\" and \"extremely vicious\" Panthers and had defended themselves accordingly. In a second press conference on December 8th, the police leadership praised the assault team for their \"remarkable restraint\", \"bravery\", and \"professional discipline\" in not killing all the Panthers present.\n\nPhotographic evidence was presented of bullet holes allegedly made by shots fired by the Panthers, but this was soon challenged by reporters. It was later found that all but one of nearly 100 shots were fired by police.\n\nHis death was ruled a justified homicide at the time, although a civil lawsuit filed on behalf of the survivors and the relatives of Hampton and Clark won $1.85 million dollars in damages in 1982.",

Nixon, used her arrest to launch a bus boycott to try and change the city's bus policies.\n\nThe boycott had widespread support in the black community, and black taxi drivers lowered their fares to match the cost of taking a bus in solidarity. In response, the membership of the \"White Citizen's Council\" increased dramatically.\n\nMany acts of terrorism were committed by whites in response to the boycott - the homes of Martin Luther King Jr. and Ralph Abernathy were firebombed, boycotters were often physically attacked, and dozens of activists were arrested.\n\nThe boycott ended on December 20th of 1956, when the city passed an ordinance allowing black members to sit where they wanted on the bus. The campaign of white terrorism continued, however, and all within the month that followed integration on buses, multiple churches were bombed, buses were subject to sniper fire, and at least one black man was lynched.",

A few months earlier, 8,000 workers held management hostage and placed gas cylinders on the roof of the building, threatening to blow the factory up if their wages were not paid.\n\nThe December 6th riots became violent when fights broke out between private security and the workers; police intervened by shooting into the crowd of workers. Although official numbers listed 11 dead workers, others have claimed more than 100 people died. 300 workers disappeared in the aftermath of the violence. Both sources provided below state that the government's figures are false, and that the police shooting was completely unjustified.",

As a result of severe labor shortages in Taranto, Italy, the West Indians had to carry out arduous physical tasks, unloading ships and cleaning toilets for white soldiers. Black members were also not allowed to have a rank higher than Sergeant, and white soldiers were given a pay raise while black soldiers were not.\n\nUnder these conditions, the men of the 9th Battalion revolted and attacked their black officers. The mutiny lasted four days. Approximately 60 soldiers were tried for mutiny and those convicted received sentences ranging from three to five years, although one was executed by firing squad.\n\nIn the aftermath of the crushed rebellion, an organization called the \"Caribbean League\" was formed by West Indian soldiers. When one sergeant stated \"the black man should have freedom and govern himself in the West Indies and that if necessary, force and bloodshed should be used to attain that object\" at a meeting, he was loudly applauded by the majority of those present.\n\nThe soldiers decided to hold a general strike for higher wages on their return to the West Indies. A secret memo written by the British government in 1919 recognized the revolutionary sentiments among the soldiers: \"Nothing we can do will alter the fact that the black man has begun to think and feel himself as good as the white.\"",

The actual number may be higher because workers would often take family members (including children) into the mines to help with their work.\n\nThe disaster was caused by an explosion that occurred in Fairmont Coal Company's No. 6 and No. 8 mines which destroyed the ventilation shafts and caused the roof to collapse. Rescue attempts were greatly hindered because the air was not fit to breathe - rescuers could not be in the mine for more than fifteen minutes at a time. Only one worker was rescued, another four escaped.\n\nChief Mine Inspector James W. Paul concluded that Fairmont Coal Company was operating within the bounds of state law. The disaster was one of the contributing events that led to the creation of the United States Bureau of Mines.",

An outspoken opponent of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, which he saw as an act of American imperialism, in 1967 Chomsky rose to national attention for his antiwar essay \"The Responsibility of Intellectuals\".\n\nAssociated with the New Left, he was arrested multiple times for his activism and placed on President Richard Nixon's Enemies List. Chomsky, along with Howard Zinn, was also on a list of American citizens that could be arrested without probable cause in the event of a national emergency.\n\nIn collaboration with Edward S. Herman, Chomsky later theorized a propaganda model of mass media in their work \"Manufacturing Consent\" (1988).",

The MPLA fought for their independence from Portuguese colonizers, alongside the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC), the Mozambique Liberation Front (FRELIMO) and CLSTP, forerunner of the Movement for the Liberation of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe.\n\nFrom 1961 to 1974, the MLPA waged a guerrilla liberation war against the Portuguese colonial government in Angola. Following the Carnation Revolution in Portugal, the newly-established Portuguese military government granted Angola independence, which was to be led by a coalition of different anti-colonial liberation armies.\n\nThe coalition quickly broke apart, erupting into a civil war between the MPLA, the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA), and the Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). The MLPA won the war, and has ruled Angola since 1975.\n\nAt its first congress in 1977, the MPLA adopted Marxism-Leninism as its official ideology. Receiving military support from Cuba and the Soviet Union, they maintained control over most territory in Angola, despite extensive aid to the FNLA and UNITA from South Africa, Zaire, and the United States.\n\nBoth the MPLA and UNITA were complicit in war crimes; more than 500,000 civilians were killed during the civil war.\n\nAfter the end of the Cold War and collapse of the Soviet Union, the MPLA renounced Marxism-Leninism in favor of social democracy. Though no longer a proxy war between the USA and the USSR, the Angolan civil war lasted until 2002, when a peace agreement was finally reached.",

The Society for Human Rights also published the earliest-documented homosexual periodical, Friendship and Freedom. Although Gerber (shown above) founded the group, a black clergyman named John T. Graves was its first president, with Gerber serving as a director.\n\nGerber set out to expand the Society's membership beyond the original seven but had difficulty interesting anyone other than poorer gays in joining. More affluent members of Chicago's gay community refused to join his society, not wanting to ruin their reputations by being associated with homosexuality.\n\nThe Society was only a chartered organization for a few months before police arrested Gerber and several other members. After their arrests, the Chicago Examiner reported the story under the headline \"Strange Sex Cult Exposed\".\n\nGerber was subjected to three highly publicized trials, and his defense, while ultimately successful, cost him his life savings. Unable to continue funding the Society, the group dismantled, and Gerber left for New York City, embittered that none of the wealthier gays of Chicago had come to his aid for a cause he believed was designed to advance the common good.",

The massacre was carried out by units of the Salvadoran army's Atlacatl Battalion, which was created in 1980 at the U.S. Army's School of the Americas.\n\nSoldiers separated the population of el Mozote into men, women, and children, and began by torturing and executing the men. Girls as young as 10 were raped, and they murdered the children by cutting their throats and hanging them from trees. At least one child killed in this way was reportedly two years old.\n\nThe NY Times and Washington Post reporters who broke the story in early 1982 were heavily criticized, and both the U.S. and Salvadoran governments denied or downplayed the incident. Officials of the Reagan administration called them \"gross exaggerations\" and as late as 2001, U.S. official Elliott Abrams said that Washington's policy in El Salvador was a \"fabulous achievement.\"\n\nIn December 2011, the government of El Salvador formally apologized for the massacre.",

The deaths were caused by an explosion, so large it shook houses for three miles, in the mines, trapping workers inside.\n\nThe Oaks was a notoriously dangerous mine, and ten years earlier the 400-strong workforce had gone on an unsuccessful ten-week strike because of management incompetence. On the day of the explosion, 340 people, adults and children, were underground.\n\nMultiple rescue attempts were made over the following days, however they had to be abandoned because of continuing explosions within the mine. A 29-strong party led by mine engineer Parkin Jeffcock was killed during one of the rescue operations. No one was ever held accountable for the death of the workers or the dangerous work conditions of the Oaks Colliery.",

He is regarded as the forefather of the idea of revolutionary industrial unionism and was the leading figure in the Socialist Labor Party of America from 1890 until the time of his death.\n\nDe Leon is also notable for splitting with \"Big Bill\" Haywood on the matter of electoral politics. Haywood supported direct action - working outside the system - while De Leon supported political action via a socialist political party. Eventually, this disagreement caused De Leon to leave the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) entirely.\n\n\"We Socialists are not reformers; we are revolutionaries. We Socialists do not propose change forms. We care nothing for forms. We want a change of the inside of the mechanism of society, let the form take care of itself.\" - Daniel De Leon",

Foner's three brothers were also fired, and he became blacklisted from working in academia.\n\nToday, Foner is perhaps most strongly remembered for his works \"A History of the Labor Movement of the United States\" and \"The Life and Writings of Frederick Douglass\", both completed while he was excluded from formal academic work.",

Sitting Bull was Lakota, and formed cross-tribal alliances in his efforts to resist the process of colonization. Sitting Bull also steadfastly refused to become dependent on the U.S. government.\n\nOn June 25th, 1876, Colonel Custer and his forces were wiped out at the battle of Little Big Horn. Sitting Bull did not take part in the battle, but acted as a kind of spiritual leader to those who did, performing the Sun Dance, in which he fasted and sacrificed over 100 pieces of flesh from his arms, a week prior. Following this battle, the U.S. government sent thousands of soldiers to the area, causing many Lakota to surrender.\n\nIn 1890, due to fears that Sitting Bull would use his influence to support the Ghost Dance movement (a movement of indigenous resistance), Indian Service agent James McLaughlin ordered his arrest. Early on the morning December 15th, 39 police officers and four volunteers approached Sitting Bull's house. The camp awakened and men converged at the house.\n\nWhen Sitting Bull refused to comply, the police used force on him, enraging the Sioux in the village. Catch-the-Bear, a Lakota, shouldered his rifle and shot one of the Indian agents, who reacted by firing his revolver into the chest of Sitting Bull. In 1953, his Lakota family exhumed what were believed to be his remains, reburying them near Mobridge, South Dakota, near his birthplace.",

He organized young anarchists in the \"Gioventu Libertaria\" (Libertarian Youth) in 1962 and helped found the \"Sacco and Vanzetti anarchist association\" in 1965.\n\nA few days before Pinelli's death, Italian fascists from the \"Ordine Nuovo\" orchestrated a bombing campaign in Milan; one bomb in Piazza Fontana killed 17 people and injured 88. The bombing was blamed on Italian anarchists, and Pinelli was detained along with many other leftists, including Pietro Valpreda, who was falsely convicted and served eighteen years in prison.\n\nJust before midnight on December 15th, 1969, Pinelli fell to his death from a fourth floor window of the Milan police station. Three police officers interrogating Pinelli, including Commissioner Luigi Calabresi, were put under investigation in 1971 for his death, but legal proceedings concluded it was due to accidental causes. Calabresi was later gunned down at his home in 1972, for which Adriano Sofri was convicted in 1997.",

He then joined the Korea Justice Corps, later becoming the general commander of the Northern Military Administration Office Army and playing a key role in the \"Battle of Cheongsanri\" against japanese forces.\n\nIn 1928, the Korea Independence Party was formed, and the following year, when the Korean General Association was established as the successor of the new people, Chwa-chin was designated as the President.

        "description": "Joseph Stalin, born on this day in 1878, was a Marxist-Leninist revolutionary and politician who led the Soviet Union from the mid-1920s until his death in 1953.\n\nBorn to a poor family in modern day Georgia, Stalin joined the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party as a youth. He edited the party's newspaper Pravda and raised funds for Vladimir Lenin's Bolshevik faction via robberies, kidnappings, and protection rackets. After the Bolsheviks seized power during the 1917 October Revolution, Stalin joined its governing Politburo and assumed leadership over the country following Lenin's 1924 death.\n\nThrough the Five-Year Plans developed under his leadership, the Soviet Union collectivized its agricultural sector and rapidly industrialized, creating a centralized command economy. This rapid change caused disruptions in food production that were a factor in the famine of 1932 - 1933. Despite this, the first five-year plan greatly increased the country's productive capacity.\n\nStalin's legacy is polarizing among leftist thinkers and movements. Although the Soviet Union under his leadership succeeded in rapidly industrializing Russia, helping end Russian monarchial rule, defeating fascist movements in Europe, and opposing American imperialism, his reign was marred by severe political repression, suppression of labor movements, episodes of ethnic cleansing during the Great Purge of 1937-38, and the criminalization of homosexuality.\n\nShortly after Stalin's death, the Soviet Union went through a period of \"de-Stalinization\". His successor, Nikita Khrushchev, gave a series of remarks titled \"On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences\" (also known as the \"Secret Speech\") to a closed session of the national congress, denouncing Stalin's political repression and the cult of personality that surrounded him.",

In 1973, he was appointed to the position of Prime Ministers. Six months into his term, he was assassinated by the ETA while returning from mass at San Francisco de Borja church.\n\nFor five months, the ETA members dug under the street from a rented out basement near his route. On the day of the attack, members disguised as electricians were present on the scene to trigger detonation.\n\nIn a collective interview justifying the attack, the ETA bombers said Carrero Blanco \"symbolized better than anyone else the figure of 'pure Francoism' and without totally linking himself to any of the Francoist tendencies...\" and called him \"a man without scruples\".\n\nThe assassination had far-reaching political implications, and is credited with helping Spain become more democratic. Carrero Blanco's successor, Carlos Arias Navarro, promised liberalizing reforms, including the right to form political associations. Franco himself died in 1975, and elections in Spain were held in 1977, with a new constitution being approved the following year.",

He immediately launched programs for social, ecological, and economic change, as well as renaming the country from the French colonial \"Upper Volta\" to Burkina Faso (\"Land of Incorruptible People\"), with its people being called Burkinab\u00e9 (\"upright people\").\n\nHis administration was known for refusing foreign aid to remain politically independent, nationalizing the country's land and mineral wealth, and promoting literacy, women's rights, and public health. Among the achievements of his administration was vaccinating 2.5 million children against meningitis, yellow fever and measles.\n\nOn October 15th, 1987, Sankara was assassinated by troops led by Blaise Compaor\u00e9, who assumed leadership of the state shortly after having Sankara killed. A week before his assassination, Sankara declared: \"While revolutionaries as individuals can be murdered, you cannot kill ideas\".",

A veteran of the U.S. Army, the racism he experienced in the military led him to begin tenant organizing in New York City, where he joined the Black Panther Party. He was one of the defendants in the Panther 21 case.\n\nBalagoon later escaped from Rahway State Prison in New Jersey and went underground with the Black Liberation Army (BLA) in 1978. On October 20th, 1981, he was captured while participating in an armored truck robbery (known as the Brinks Robbery of 1981) which killed two cops and a money courier.

In New York City, Isca helped spread anarchist ideas, a champion of the libertarian socialism advocated by Peter Kropotkin.\n\nSpeaking to anarchist historian Paul Avrich, he stated \"Anarchism at bottom is an ethical philosophy. When a man realizes that it is immoral to exploit another man and immoral to oppress another man, and when he refuses to do so, that man has become an anarchist, as far as I am concerned.\"",

He became skeptical of the Soviet Union after the failed Kronstadt rebellion in 1921, which solidified his anarchist leanings.\n\nHere is a poem composed by Rexroth on the subject of anarchists Bartomeleo Vanzetti and Nicola Sacco who were executed by the state:\n\n\"I saw you both marching in an army\n\nYou with the red and black flag, Sacco with the\n\nrattlesnake banner.\n\nI kicked steps up the last snow bank and came\n\nTo the indescribably blue and fragrant\n\nPolemonium and the dead sky and the sterile\n\nCrystalline granite and final monolith of the summit.\n\nThese are the things that will last a long time,\n\nVanzetti,\n\nI am glad that once on your day I have stood among them.\n\nSome day mountains will be named after you and Sacco.\n\nThey will be here and your name with them,\n\nWhen these days are but a dim remembering of the time\n\nWhen man was wolf to man.\n\nI think men will be remembering you a long time\n\nStanding on the mountains\n\nMany men, a long time, comrade.\"",

It is one of the largest slave rebellions in the British Caribbean and was a major factor in the British government outlawing slavery in 1833. The name \"Baptist War\" came about because many of the rebels were Baptist in faith.\n\nThe rebellion was masterminded by the slave Samuel \"Daddy\" Sharpe, who had been given limited freedom to move around the island. Using this freedom of movement, Sharpe spread word of his plan and communicated with other slave leaders. After one prayer meeting, Sharpe cited examples of earlier slave revolts to encourage his followers, and then had them swear on a Bible to follow the plan he outlined.\n\nThe rebellion began on Christmas day when leaders of the uprising went on strike, demanding more free time and a working wage. The strike escalated into open revolt two days later, when the planters refused their demands. Sugar cane fields were set on fire and a rebel military group known as the Black Regiment defeated slaver forces on December 28th.\n\nThe rebellion was put down in early January, however sporadic resistance continued for another two months as the rebels resorted to guerilla tactics. More than three hundred enslaved men and women were executed for their role in the uprising, including Samuel Sharpe, who was hanged.",

The paper did not continue past 1933 and, by the end of the war, only six of the organizers involved with it survived; twenty-seven had been murdered by the Gestapo.\n\nAfter the war, Jelinek continued organizing with anarchists in East Germany, where he was critical of the Soviet state. In an unpublished pamphlet, written in 1947, Jelinek denounced the dictatorship of the proletariat \"...which signifies the authority of the leaders. Where there is obedience, there are leaders who command\". On November 10th, 1948, he was arrested by two Russian officers, and his son-in-law was arrested, disappearing without a trace.\n\nAlthough temporarily released, Jelinek continued to associate with anarchists and was once again arrested, this time sent to Bautzen, an East German prison. Under mysterious circumstances, he died there on March 24th, 1952.",

The congress lasted until January 2nd, and was punctuated by police raids and arrests.\n\nThe congress was decidedly anti-Soviet and anti-social democracy in character, with \"delegates accusing Bolshevism of suppressing revolution in Russia and creating a new state-capitalist system\" according to historian Vadim Damier. The delegates of this congress also voted in favor of forming the IWA, which still exists today.",

The local hospital would not treat black people, and Harry died on the way to the nearest one that would, 30 miles away in Sanford, Florida. Harriette died from her wounds nine days later, on January 3rd, 1952, at the same hospital. Their deaths were two of the earliest assassinations in the civil rights movement.\n\nAlthough the Federal Bureau of Investigation investigated their murders, no one was ever prosecuted. A state investigation and forensic work in 2005 identified four Ku Klux Klan members who likely committed the bombing, however they had all been dead for many years.",

The war began on August 17th, 1862 in southwest Minnesota after four Dakota were killed by white settlers, leading tribe members to initiate a series of violent attacks on settlers throughout the Minnesota River Valley in an attempt to drive them out of the area.\n\nOver the next several months, battles of the Dakota against settlers and later, the United States Army, ended with the surrender of most of the Dakota bands. By late December 1862, US soldiers had taken captive more than a thousand Dakota, including women, children and elderly men in addition to warriors. A military tribunal tried the men, sentencing 303 to death for their crimes.\n\nPresident Lincoln commuted the sentence of 264 of them, and the remaining 38 were executed on December 26th in Mankato, Minnesota. The following year, the rest of the Dakota were expelled from Minnesota to Nebraska and South Dakota, and the United States Congress abolished their reservations.",

There, he joined a small community of outlaws gathered in Jersey and published \"La question r\u00e9volutionnaire\", an exposition of the philosophy of anarchism.\n\nLater, D\u00e9jacque moved to the UNited States, where he publicly condemned the hanging of John Brown abd promoted the abolitionist cause. As the American Civil War began, D\u00e9jacque published a last issue of his paper \"Libertaire\" with an urgent appeal in which he urges the American people, whom he would like to be \"less religious and more socialist\", to defend freedom and the Republic against the \"Jesuits, slavers, absolutists and authoritarians\" who were at their door.\n\nHe then returned to France, living his remaining years in poverty and passing away in 1864.",

He felt it equated the Seminole with slaves, who were forbidden by law to carry arms.\n\nEarlier in 1835, Thompson had Osceola imprisoned for two nights in Fort King becase he felt disrespected by the Seminole warrior in a verbal disagreement. On December 28th, 1835, Seminole warriors shot and killed Thompson and six others outside Fort King, while another group of Seminole ambushed and killed a column of 100 U.S. troops who were marching from Fort Brooke to Fort King. This event is sometimes called the Dade Massacre or Dade Battle, and was a catalyst for the impending Second Seminole War.\n\nOn October 21st, 1837, in what has been called \"one of the most disgraceful acts in U.S. military history\", Osceola was captured after U.S. forces disingenuously agreed to meet under a white flag of truce.

K of L was notable in its ambition to organize across lines of gender and race and in the inclusion of both skilled and unskilled labor, although its support of the Chinese Exclusion Act is a notable exception to this.\n\nAfter a rapid expansion in the mid-1880s, the organization went into decline, primarily losing members to the American Federation of Labor (AFL).",

        "description": "On this day in 1905, Idaho Govenor Frank Steunenberg, who had arrested striking workers en masse and detained them without trial, was assassinated by a bomb on the door to his office.\n\nThe event took place in the context of militant labor disputes in Idaho, in which the U.S. government crushed organizing by the Western Federation of Miners (WFM). Steunenberg took a hard line against these labor organizers, declaring martial law and asking President McKinley to send federal troops to assist him in crushing the union movement.\n\nThe unions, many of which had supported Steunenberg, felt betrayed. Activists were particularly angry about Steunenberg's attempts to justify his actions, with one stating \"We have taken the monster by the throat and we are going to choke the life out of it. No halfway measures will be adopted. It is a plain case of the state or the union winning, and we do not propose that the state shall be defeated.\"\n\nNotable Pinkerton Agent James McParland was called in to investigate the murder. McParland arrested Harry Orchard, a stranger who had been staying at a local hotel, and helped him draft a confession, assuring Orchard that providing evidence against the WFM would prevent him from being executed. Orchard complied, naming William Hayward (general secretary of WFM), Charles Moyer (WFM president), and union member George Pettibone as accomplices.\n\nDuring the three month trial, the prosecutor was unable to present any information against Hayward, Moyer and Pettibone except for the testimony of Orchard. All three were acquitted. Harry Orchard, because he had provided evidence against the other men, received life imprisonment rather than the death penalty.",

The tension was so great that locals were advising tourists to stay away from the hotel and its casino.\n\nOn December 31st, hotel workers voted to go on strike, and three of the labor organizers used chafing fuel to set a storage room on the ground floor on fire.\n\nAlthough their intent was to merely pressure management into agreeing to union demands, it quickly burned out of control, spreading to the adjacent ballroom and then casino. To prevent theft, hotel managers had locked emergency exits from the casino, and most of the deaths occurred there.\n\nThe fire claimed between 96 and 98 lives and caused 140 injuries, becoming the most catastrophic hotel fire in Puerto Rican history and the second deadliest in the history of the United States. The three labor organizers were convicted of murder and sentenced to varying prison terms.",
