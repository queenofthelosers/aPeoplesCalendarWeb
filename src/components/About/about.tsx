        <p className="aboutText">A People's Calendar (aPC) is a project that seeks to promote the worldwide history of working class movements and liberation struggles in the form of a searchable "On This Day" calendar. This history includes, but is not limited to, indigenous resistance against colonization, the black liberation struggle, unionization efforts, slave rebellions, the women's suffrage movement, and workers' revolution.</p>
        <p className="aboutText">The inspiration to make the calendar came from historian Howard Zinn's book "A People's History of the United States". Zinn's scholarship and political activism demonstrates that, if we are to understand how to approach our own struggles today, we have to begin by understanding the history of liberation struggle. Unfortunately, this history is often suppressed, and overwhelming in complexity.</p>
        <p className="aboutText">While not comprehensive, it is our hope that this calendar makes these topics easier to approach. The figures and events included here are not presented with an endorsement, but rather shared with the understanding that the history of all forms of liberation struggle are worth knowing, in both their successes and their failures.</p>
        <p className="aboutText">Although we do our best to fact-check the summaries of each event, this project is ultimately meant to provide a jumping off point for users to research the history and form their own opinions on the matter, using the sourced information below the summary of each event.</p>
        <p className="aboutText">
          We are always looking out for important events, people, and texts that are missing from the calendar. You can make suggestions, sign up to volunteer, or just say hello via
