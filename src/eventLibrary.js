        description: `On this day in 1804, the Haitian Republic was established by self-liberated slaves, the culmination of years of violent revolt against French colonizers. The Haitian Revolution was the only slave uprising that led to the founding of a state which was both free from slavery, and ruled by non-whites and former captives.\n\nThe revolt began on August 21st, 1791, in what was then the French colony of Saint-Domingue. After a well-attended vodou ceremony, thousands of slaves began to kill their masters and plunged the colony into civil war. Within the next ten days, slaves had taken control of the entire Northern Province in an uprising of unprecedented scale.\n\nThe fighting was particularly brutal, and more than 200,000 black people died in the years from the initial uprising until independence.\n\nAlthough Toussaint Louverture established himself as a military leader of the revolution by 1801, he died shortly before independence was won. Jean-Jacques Dessalines, his former lieutenant, became the first leader of Haiti.`,

This action was taken at least partly in response to the enactment of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which was perceived as a threat to the lives of indigenous people in Chiapas.\n\nFollowing this war declaration, armed indigenous rebels seized four towns in Chiapas, Mexico, releasing nearly 200 predominantly indigenous prisoners and destroying land records. The fighting lasted eleven days and estimates of those killed range from 300-400. The EZLN remains active to this day.`,

He was a charter member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in Amite County and sought to enfranchise black Americans by encouraging voter registration.\n\nIn 1961, Lee assisted Bob Moses, a field secretary with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), in his efforts to persuade locals to register. His activities were met with threats of reprisal by the white community, and Lee became one of the movement's earliest victims to white violence. On September 25th, 1961, Lee was murdered by Mississippi state representative E. H. Hurst (1908 - 1990) in broad daylight at the cotton gin while delivering cotton near Liberty.\n\nHurst killed Lee with a single shot to the head, but later claimed in court that he was defending himself after Lee attacked him with a tire iron. An all-white jury ruled that the killing was a justifiable homicide. In 1964, civil rights activist Louis Allen was killed after he informed federal investigators that his testimony in the case was forced on threat of violence.`,

He regarded these as a new form of organization capable of overcoming the limitations of the old institutions of the labor movement, the trade unions and social democratic parties.\n\nHe was a sharp critic of anarchism, social democracy, and Leninism. During the early years of the Russian revolution, Pannekoek gave critical support to the Bolsheviks. In later analysis, however, Pannekoek argued that the Bolsheviks crippled the workers' soviets, and formed a new ruling class of their own party. Unlike some other progressives of his time, Pannekoek was also highly critical of social darwinism, derisively calling it "bourgeois darwinism".`,

        description: `The Palmer Raids were a series of raids conducted in November 1919 and January 1920 during the First Red Scare by the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) under the administration of President Woodrow Wilson. The raids targeted suspected leftists and labor activists, mostly Italian and Eastern European immigrants, especially if they were anarchists or communists, and generally sought to deport them from the United States.\n\nThe raids and arrests occurred under the leadership of Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer, with more than 3,000 arrested. Though 556 people were deported, including many prominent leftist leaders like Emma Goldman, Palmer's efforts were largely frustrated by officials at the U.S. Department of Labor, which had authority for deportations and objected to methods.\n\nOn this day in 1920, the Justice Department launched its second series of raids against leftists and labor organizers across more than 23 states, arresting more than 3,000 people. Because the raids targeted entire organizations, agents engaged in mass arrests, and President Hoover later admitted that there were "clear cases of brutality".\n\nAlthough the DoJ initially claimed to have taken possession of several bombs, no evidence of the bombs was produced. In their entirety, all the raids only confiscated four pistols.`,

In 1848, she was invited by Jane Hunt to a meeting that led to the first meeting about women's rights. Mott helped write the Declaration of Sentiments during the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention.\n\nWhen slavery was outlawed in 1865, she advocated giving former slaves who had been bound to slavery laws within the boundaries of the United States, whether male or female, the right to vote. She remained a central figure in the abolition and suffrage movement until her death in 1880.`,

Despite this perception, modern historians note that he had not exacted revenge for his brother's murder at the hands of a settler and rival tribe, and had saved at least one settler's life in a raid, suggesting Dundalli had adopted a more conciliatory policy of moderation rather than "savage" violence.\n\nIn 1854, Dundalli entered Brisbane to be paid for removing a felled tree and was arrested by the police. Tried and convicted for murder on flimsy evidence, he was hanged a few months later on this day in 1855.`,

On September 23rd, 1868, the Revolutionary Committee, led by Betances, declared independence in the city of Lares, Puerto Rico, calling it the Republic of Puerto Rico.\n\nSeveral hundred rebels took over city hall, looted stores owned by "peninsulares" (Spanish-born men), and took some of the store owners prisoner. The revolution was put down however by the Spanish militia and around 475 rebels imprisoned. The event became known as "El Grito de Lares" (shown above).`,

Here is an excerpt from their statement:\n\n"We believe the United States government has been deceptive in its claims of concern for the freedom of the Vietnamese people, just as the government has been deceptive in claiming concern for the freedom of colored people in other countries as the Dominican Republic, the Congo, South Africa, Rhodesia, and in the United States itself.\n\n...We question, then, the ability and even the desire of the United States government to guarantee free elections abroad. We maintain that our country's cry of 'preserve freedom in the world' is a hypocritical mask, behind which it squashes liberation movements which are not bound, and refuse to be bound, by the expediencies of United States cold war policies.\n\n...We recoil with horror at the inconsistency of a supposedly "free" society where responsibility to freedom is equated with the responsibility to lend oneself to military aggression...We ask, where is the draft for the freedom fight in the United States?"`,

Giovannitti was a member of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), and is best remembered for his leadership and subsequent arrest in the 1912 Lawrence Textile Strike.\n\nAlong with "Smiling Joe" Ettor, Giovannitti was sent to Lawrence to help rally and organize striking workers there. When a striking worker was shot and killed, Ettor and Giovannitti were arrested as accomplices to the murder on little to no evidence.\n\nWhile in jail, he wrote many poems, "The Walker" in particular becoming well-known. The trial made the textile strike a national controversy and resulted in "Big Bill" Haywood and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn coming in to lead the strike in their stead. Months after the strike itself ended, Ettor, Giovannitti, and a third co-defendant were acquitted of all charges.`,

Confrontations with militia and executions after various trials killed 95 black people, while only two white people were killed.\n\nOn the first day, 64-125 enslaved men marched from sugar plantations in and near present-day LaPlace on the German Coast toward the city of New Orleans, collecting more men as they traveled. During their two-day, twenty-mile march, the men burned five plantation houses (three completely), several sugarhouses, and crops, armed with little more than hand tools.\n\nThe revolt ended when white planters, aided by Native American trackers, captured and executed Charles Deslondes (suspected leader of the revolt). In the following days, nearly one hundred slaves were either sentenced to death in unfair trials or hunted down and summarily executed.`,

That evening, less than a hundred police were overwhelmed by several thousand protesters who set fire to American-owned businesses in the area. U.S. troops were put on the ground to quell the rebellion.\n\nIn total, at least twenty-two Panamanians and four U.S. soldiers died in the fighting. The event is now a national day of mourning in Panama, commemorated annually as "Martyr's Day". The riots are considered to be a significant factor in the U.S. decision to transfer control of the Canal Zone to Panama through the 1977 Torrijos-Carter Treaties.`,

His death triggered international outcry, and his life was prominently memorialized in writing, monuments, and demonstrations across three continents.`,

It was led by the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and united immigrant workers of over forty nationalities. Prompted by a two-hour pay cut corresponding to a new law shortening the workweek for women, the strike spread rapidly through the town, growing to more than twenty thousand workers and involving nearly every mill in Lawrence.\n\nNational attention to the strike greatly increased when two IWW leaders, "Smiling Joe" Ettor and Arturo Giovannitti, were arrested on fabricated charges related to the murder of a striking worker. Upon their arrest, "Big Bill" Haywood and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn took over leadership of the strike. They further sensationalized the condition of the striking workers by ostentatiously sending their hungry children to stay with families and supporters in New York City.\n\nStriking workers and families were brutalized by police. When authorities tried to prevent more children from leaving the city, the police attacked a crowd of parents and their children, causing one pregnant woman to miscarry. Growing national sympathy for the strikers finally led the mill owners to agree to worker demands, and the parties agreed on significant pay raises to return to work. Ettor and Giovannitti were in prison for months after the strike ended, but were eventually acquitted of all charges.`,

Labor unions, such as the UGTT, also played an integral role in organizing the protests.`,

A pioneer in the environmental movement, Bookchin developed a theory of social ecology, urban planning, and anti-capitalist politics.\n\nHe was the author of two dozen books covering topics in politics, philosophy, history, urban affairs, and social ecology. Some notable titles include "Our Synthetic Environment", "Post-Scarcity Anarchism", and "The Ecology of Freedom". In the late 1990s, he became disenchanted with what he saw as an increasingly apolitical "lifestylism" of the contemporary anarchist movement and stopped referring to himself as an anarchist.\n\nHis ideas have influenced social movements since the 1960s, including the New Left, the anti-nuclear movement, the anti-globalization movement, Occupy Wall Street, and, most notably, Abdullah Öcalan's concept of democratic confederalism and its application in Rojava.`,

The uprising was forcibly put down by the Freikorps and, for their role in it, both Luxemberg and Liebknecht were tortured and summarily executed by the government forces on this day that year.\n\nKarl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg have since become celebrated martyrs of the German left. Since 1919, an annual Liebknecht-Luxemburg Demonstration has been held in Berlin, the world's largest funerary parade and the biggest meeting of the German left. The annual "L-L Demo" is held on the second Sunday in January. In 2016, 14,000 people attended the rally in Liebknecht's and Luxemburg's honor.`,

He was the first person to declare himself an anarchist, using that term, and is widely regarded as one of the ideology's most influential theorists, sometimes called "the father of anarchism". He became a member of the French Parliament after the Revolution of 1848, whereafter he referred to himself as a federalist.\n\nProudhon favored workers' associations or co-operatives as well as individual worker and peasant possession over private ownership or the nationalization of land and workplaces. In "The Confessions of a Revolutionary", Proudhon asserted that "Anarchy is Order Without Power", the phrase which much later inspired in the view of some the anarchist circled-A symbol.\n\nIt is worth noting that, despite his egalitarian beliefs in other respects, Proudhon was an avowed sexist and anti-Semite. One notorious (unpublished) quote reads "The Jew is the enemy of the human race. This race must be sent back to Asia, or exterminated." Proudhon also maintained that a woman's choice was to be "courtesan or housekeeper", stating that man is "a father, a chief, a master: above all, a master". Joseph Déjacque, a contemporary libertarian communist, told Proudhon to "speak out against man's exploitation of woman" or "do not describe yourself as an anarchist".\n\nProudhon also unsuccessfully tried to create a national bank, to be funded by what became an abortive attempt at an income tax on capitalists and shareholders. Similar in some respects to a credit union, it would have given interest-free loans.`,

King is best known for advancing civil rights through nonviolence and civil disobedience, inspired by his Christian beliefs and the nonviolent activism of Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nOn October 14th, 1964, King won the Nobel Peace Prize for combating racial inequality through nonviolent resistance. In 1965, he helped organize the Selma to Montgomery marches. In his final years, he expanded his focus to include opposition towards poverty, capitalism, and the Vietnam War.\n\nFor his activism, he was the target of multiple assassination attempts, arrested 23 times, and surveilled and harassed by the police. In particular, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover harassed Dr. King by making him a target of COINTELPRO, a secret program where FBI agents spied on, infiltrated, and attempted to discredit "subversive" political movements.\n\nIn 1968, King and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference organized the "Poor People's Campaign" to address issues of economic justice. King traveled the country to assemble "a multiracial army of the poor" that would march on Washington to engage in nonviolent civil disobedience at the Capitol until Congress created an "economic bill of rights" for poor Americans.\n\nBefore the plans for the march could come to fruition, however, King was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee while supporting striking black sanitation workers. James Earl Rey was convicted for the murder, but speculation of government involvement has persisted for decades after his death.`,

Lumumba served as the first Prime Minister of the independent Democratic Republic of the Congo from June until September 1960 and played a significant role in the transformation of the Congo from a colony of Belgium into an independent republic.\n\nIdeologically an African nationalist and pan-Africanist, he led the Congolese National Movement (MNC) party from 1958 until his assassination, in a coup by Joseph-Désiré Mobutu. The coup occurred when Lumumba, facing armed rebellion and an occupation by Belgian forces, asked for support from the Soviet Union. This led to a government split between himself, President Joseph Kasa-Vubu, and military commander Joseph-Désiré Mobutu.\n\nOn December 1st, 1960, Lumumba was captured by Mobutu's forces and imprisoned. On January 17th, 1961, he and his associates were brutally beaten and tortured by Katangan and Belgian officers, and Lumumba was executed later that night. The execution was carried out with Belgian and U.S. assistance. Belgium formally apologized for its role in the assassination in 2002.\n\nOn Lumumba's legacy, his friend and colleague Thomas Kanza wrote the following:\n\n"He lived as a free man, and an independent thinker. Everything he wrote, said and did was the product of someone who knew his vocation to be that of a liberator, and he represents for the Congo what Castro does for Cuba, Nasser for Egypt, Nkrumah for Ghana, Mao Tse-tung for China, and Lenin for Russia."`,

The CPC went on to achieve a new base of operations in Shaanxi Province and continued its revolutionary activity from there.\n\nThe Conference was completely unacknowledged until the 1950s and still no detailed descriptions were available until the fiftieth anniversary in 1985, and has now become a popular tourist destination in China.`,

Grand Dragon James W. "Catfish" Cole was the organizer of the Klan rally. Sanford Locklear, Simeon Oxendine and Neill Lowery were leaders of the Lumbee who attacked the Klansmen and successfully disrupted the rally.\n\nThe year prior, Cole had initiated a campaign of harassment designed to intimidate the Lumbee Tribe to help organize the local Klan. He called a rally on January 18th, and 100 Klansmen arrived at the private field near Hayes Pond which Cole had leased from a sympathetic farmer. Cole managed to erect the cross, but before he could finish the arrangements, over 500 Lumbee men appeared and encircled the assembled Klansmen.\n\nFour Klansmen were injured in the exchange of gunfire. Cole was later found guilty of inciting a riot and sentenced to two years in prison.`,

The battle lasted until January 19th, and was broadcast on television, causing a national sensation.\n\nThe protest was part of a growing leftist sentiment against the US and the conservative Japanese government that led to more than 10,000 young people being arrested by the end of the year. One year after this event, more than 22 colleges were either closed or only partially open due to student unrest.`,

Baburova was a member of the Russian anarchist group "Autonomous Action" and a student of journalism at Moscow State University. Markelov was a lawyer who defended left-wing political activists, anti-fascists, journalists, and victims of police violence.\n\nOn January 19th, 2009, Markelov gave a press conference where he fiercely denounced the early prison release of a Russian army officer, convicted for the abduction and murder of a Chechen girl. After finishing, a masked assailant shot him in the back of the head, killing him instantly. Baburova, who was covering the press conference, was shot and killed after trying to stop the shooter.\n\nIn May 2011, the shooter Nikita Tikhonov was sentenced to life imprisonment, and his partner Eugenia Khasis was sentenced to 18 years in prison. Russian military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer has speculated that the Russian government was involved, noting that Tikhonov's use of a pistol fitted with a silencer was atypical for the neo-Nazi movement, which usually used knives and homemade explosives to commit violence.`,

Padilla himself got involved in these tensions when he wrote a scathing critique of a government bureaucrat's novel (Lisandro Otero's "Pasión de Urbino") while simultaneously giving high praise to the work of an open critic of Castro's revolution (Guillermo Cabrera Infante's "Tres Triste Tigers").\n\nPadilla was subsequently fired from his job, along with the editorial board that published his criticism. On March 20th, 1971, Heberto Padilla was arrested and jailed for his work, "Fuera del juego". One of the charges brought against Fuera del juego was Padilla's conception of history, where he described time as a circle, which was seen as counter-revolutionary.\n\nPadilla was released thirty-seven days after being imprisoned, and his incarceration brought international criticism from writers like Mario Vargas Llosa, Julio Cortázar, Susan Sontag, and Jean-Paul Sartre. He moved to the United States in 1980 and remained there for the rest of his life.`,

The goal of the conflict was to achieve independence from both Portuguese Guinea and Cape Verde.\n\nCabral was assassinated in 1973, about eight months before Guinea-Bissau's unilateral declaration of independence. Cabral's pan-Africanism and revolutionary socialism continues to be an inspiration for socialists and national independence movements worldwide.`,

She was highly critical of the existing political system in Japan, which led her to call for an anarchism to exist in "everyday practice", namely that people should in various small ways seek routinely to undermine the kokutai (a sense of national body politic). Itō also translated anarchist writings into Japanese, including works of Emma Goldman.\n\nOn September 16th, 1923, Itō, Ōsugi, and his 6-year-old nephew Munekazu were arrested, strangled to death, and thrown into an abandoned well by a squad of military police known as the "Kenpeitai". The killing of such high-profile anarchists, together with a young child, became a national controversy known as the "Amakasu Incident" (named after the leader of the squad). Lt. Amakasu was arrested and sentenced to ten years in prison for the murders, however he was released after serving only three years.`,

Gramsci wrote more than 30 notebooks and 3,000 pages of history and analysis during his imprisonment. His "Prison Notebooks" are considered a highly original contribution to 20th-century political theory.\n\nToday, Gramsci is perhaps best known for his concept of cultural hegemony, which describes how the state and ruling capitalist class use cultural institutions to maintain power in capitalist societies without resorting to force. Hegemonic culture promotes capitalist values and norms such that they become the "common sense" values of all and reinforce the status quo.`,

Until his assassination in 1973, pan-African socialist Amílcar Cabral played a key role in the revolutionary activity of PAIGC.\n\nThe first act of the revolution took place on January 23rd, when PAIGC guerrillas attacked a Portuguese garrison in Tite, near the Corubal River, south of Bissau. Similar guerrilla actions quickly spread across the colony. PAIGC had few weapons - perhaps only one submachine gun and two pistols per group - and so they attacked Portuguese convoys to gain more weapons.\n\nThe war ended when Portugal, after the Carnation Revolution of 1974, granted independence to Guinea-Bissau, with Cape Verde's independence following a year later.`,

He then joined the Korea Justice Corps, later becoming the general commander of the Northern Military Administration Office Army and playing a key role in the "Battle of Cheongsanri" against japanese forces.\n\nIn 1928, the Korea Independence Party was formed, and the following year, when the Korean General Association was established, Chwa-chin was designated as its President. During this process, conflicts between the nationalist and communist independence activists intensified. It was these tensions that led to Kim Chaw-chin's killing.`,

Their target was Joaquín Navarro, the general secretary of the transport union of the Comisiones Obreras, who at that time was leading a transport strike in Madrid. The attackers searched the office and found the eight remaining staff, however, not finding Navarro, as he had departed just before, they decided to kill all present.\n\nTold to raise their "little hands up high", the remaining eight people present were lined up against a wall and shot, killing four (the fifth victim was killed earlier) and injuring four people. One of the injured, Dolores Ruiz, was pregnant lost her child as a result of the attack.\n\nThe assassinations took place within the wider context of far-right reaction to Spain's transition to constitutional democracy following the death of dictator Francisco Franco two years prior Intended to provoke a violent left-wing response that would provide legitimacy for a subsequent right-wing counter coup d'état, the massacre had an immediate opposite effect, generating mass popular revulsion of the far-right and accelerating the legalization of the long-banned Communist Party.\n\nThe trial took place in February 1980 and the defendants were sentenced to a total of 464 years in jail, however several of the perpetrators escaped custody and fled to South America. After more than 20 years on the run, one the perpetrators, García Juliá, was arrested in Brazil in 2018. Juliá extradited to Spain in February 2020, and transferred to Soto del Real prison to serve the remainder of his sentence.`,

Among those executed were Uchiyama Gudō, a Buddhist priest and socialist who spoke out against the Meiji government for its imperialism and advocated for conscripted soldiers to desert en masse.\n\nThe pretext for this crackdown was the "High Treason Incident", a plot to assassinate the Emperor of Japan. The incident began when police searched the room of Miyashita Takichi, a young lumbermill employee, and found materials which could be used to construct bombs, concluding that there was a broader conspiracy to harm the imperial family.\n\nOn the basis of this plot, the Japanese government rounded up leftist activists from all over the country. 24 of the 26 defendants actually brought to trial were sentenced to death, despite the evidence against nearly all of them being circumstantial.\n\nPrior to his execution, Kōtoku Shūsui, etched this message on the wall of his cell: "How has it come about that I have committed this grave crime? Today my trial is hidden from outside observers and I have even less liberty than previously to speak about these events. Perhaps in 100 years someone will speak out about them on my behalf."`,

The Farm Labor Organizing Committee (FLOC) was founded in 1967 in Toledo, Ohio by Baldemar Velasquez.\n\nIn 1978, Velasquez planned an ambitious labor action, noting that Ohio tomato growers would be unable to recruit enough workers to see them through a long strike. That year, 2,000 FLOC members walked off their jobs in Ohio, demanding a guaranteed minimum wage, better housing, and medical care.\n\nWhile some growers were willing to negotiate, big canners such as the Campbell's and Nestle were unwilling to pay the higher prices which would accompany a unionized workforce. FLOC reacted by boycotting their products and marching 560 miles from Toledo, Ohio to Campbell's headquarters in Camden, New Jersey in a well-publicized protest.\n\nA resolution finally came in 1986 when FLOC, growers, and Campbell's announced a collective bargaining agreement which achieved union recognition and provided for wage increases, grievance resolution, health insurance, and committees to study pesticide safety, housing, health care, and day care issues.\n\nShortly thereafter, FLOC reached deals with Vlasic, Heinz, Dean Foods, and 23 of the largest cucumber growers in Ohio and Michigan.`,

Dunn helped organize it. Although radical organizers led the strike for the first several months, the American Federation of Labor took over negotiations in the fall of 1926 on condition of communist activists stepping aside.\n\nThe strike was memorialized by a seven reel silent movie titled "The Passaic Textile Strike", intended to generate sympathy and funds for the striking workers. Six of the seven reels survive today.`,

Fukimo is perhaps best remembered for her "The Prison Memoirs Of A Japanese Woman", written while imprisoned after being convicted of high treason against the Japenese government.\n\nTogether, Fumiko and her Korean partner Pak Yol published two magazines which highlighted the problems Koreans faced under Japanese imperialism and showed influences of their radical politics. Sometime between 1922 and 1923, they also established a group called "F"utei-sha (Society of Malcontents)", which Fumiko identified as a group for direct action against the government.\n\nThese activities soon brought Pak and Fumiko under government scrutiny. In September 1923, the Japenese government therefore made a number of arrests, mostly Koreans, on limited evidence, and among those arrested were Pak and Fumiko.\n\nAfter lengthy judicial proceedings, Fumiko and Pak were convicted of high treason for attempting to obtain bombs with the intention of killing the emperor or his son. They were both sentenced to life in prison, however Fukimo allegedly committed suicide in her cell in 1926.`,

Ideologically a Marxist, Davis was a member of the Communist Party USA until 1991, after which she joined the breakaway Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism. She is the author of over ten books on class, feminism, and the U.S. prison system.\n\nBorn to an African American family in Birmingham, Alabama, Davis studied French at Brandeis University and philosophy at the University of Frankfurt in West Germany. Back in the U.S., she joined the Communist Party and, as a Marxist feminist, involved herself in a range of leftist causes, including the second-wave feminist movement, the Black Panther Party, and the campaign against the Vietnam War.\n\nIn 1970, UCLA's governing Board of Regents soon fired her due to her Communist Party membership; after a court ruled this illegal, the university fired her again, this time for her use of inflammatory language.\n\nPraised by many Marxists and others on the left, Davis has received various awards, including the Lenin Peace Prize. Davis has been inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame. Davis was Time magazine's "Woman of the Year" for 1971 in its 2020 "100 Women of the Year" edition.\n\n"I am no longer accepting the things I cannot change.

This led to a split in the labor movement, with the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) representing the more radical advocation of labor interests via industrial unionism.\n\nGompers successfully advocated for anti-immigrant and anti-socialist politics with the AFL's influence, supporting the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and the Spanish-Civil War, and cooperating with widespread government arrests of union leaders for the IWW's militant opposition to World War I.`,

On the morning of January 27th, 1923, Wilckens met Colonel Varela on the street and hurled a bomb at him.

Due to his wounds, he could not leave the scene and was arrested there. On June 15th, Wilckens was murdered in prison by a member of the paramilitary "Liga Patriótica Argentina".\n\nOn the assassination, Wilckens said "It was not vengeance; I did not see in Varela a minor official. No, he was everything in Patagonia: governor, judge, executioner, and undertaker. I tried to hurt him as the naked symbol of a criminal system. But revenge is unworthy of an Anarchist!

        description: `On this day in 1917, seventeen year old maid Carmelita Torres refused a delousing gasoline bath from immigration authorities and sparked what is now known as the "Bath Riots".\n\nLike many other Mexicans, Carmelita Torres crossed every day from Juarez to El Paso to clean American homes. As part of this process, in order to fight a typhus outbreak, the workers were forced to strip and bathe in gasoline, which killed any lice on their bodies. On the morning of January 28th, Torres refused to be bathed, instead, convincing thirty other Mexican women to get out and protest with her.\n\nWithin an hour, there were more than 200 women blocking the entrance to El Paso. By the end of the protest, the crowd was several thousand strong. They laid in front of trains and vehicles and refused to leave when threatened with guns by the police. Eventually, the riot was subdued and Torres was arrested for her role in starting it.\n\nDespite the energized protest, the noxious delousing continued, later with insecticides like DDT, for decades afterward.`,

        description: `On this day in 1918, 200,000 workers began striking in Berlin, Germany to demand an end to World War I and the democratization of their government. By the end of the week, approximately 500,000 workers were on strike in Berlin alone, not counting workers striking elsewhere in Germany. Members of the revolutionary Spartacus League were active in the uprising, and were trying to turn the strike into a full-fledged revolution.\n\nWorkers elected a council of 414 delegates, who issued a set of demands. These included an end to the war, amnesty for all political prisoners, the democratization of government, and more and better quality food.\n\nThe rebellion was quelled with considerable force from the state on February 3rd, who viewed the strike as a threat to the current order. Despite the initial failure of the strike, on November 9th the social-democratic German Revolution of 1918 took place. Emperor Wilhelm II was forced to abdicate his throne and flee the country; German elections were held in January the following year.`,

The owner threatened the workers with a gun, but the crowd overpowered him, beating him and breaking his weapon.\n\nAfter another violent clash between a plantation owner and workers, the governor of St. Kitts deployed troops to the area. Soldiers and police attempted to control the crowd of striking workers and, on January 29th, used live ammunition on them, killing three and wounding eight. Thirty-nine strikers were arrested and six were sentenced to terms of imprisonment of from two to five years.`,

It was organized by the Liberal Party of Mexico ("Partido Liberal Mexicano", PLM), and was successful in northern Mexico; the Magonistas controlled Tijuana and Mexicali for about six months.\n\nThe capture of Mexicali began in a pre-dawn raid on January 29th, 1911, when 30 rebels, guided by José María Leyva and Simón Berthold, along with a group of residents seized the town of Mexicali without resistance. They opened the jail, killed the jailor, occupied the barracks, and confiscated government office funds.\n\nOther settlers joined the rebels as well as many foreign socialists and anarchists, mainly militant members of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), including Frank Little and Joe Hill. The U.S. government in Calexico and Yuma offered military support to aid the Mexican government's efforts to suppress the rebellion in order to protect hydraulic works of American engineers.\n\nAlthough the rebellion was launched against the rule of Porfirio Díaz, it was was put down by forces loyal to Francisco Madero, a wealthy landowner who supported reforms, and who became the Mexican President in 1911. The PLM split into factions, with one faction still supporting the incarcerated Magón brothers while the other faction supported Madero, the new president of Mexico.`,

The same night, three prisoners started a fire and burned parts of the quartermaster's warehouse, causing $100,000 of damage, although it's unclear whether this was part of the labor action.\n\nAlthough the initial group of prisoners were not settled on specific demands, 2,300 workers who went on strike the next day spent their day organizing, setting up committees and electing leaders from each wing of the prison. Out of this organization came a drafted a list of demands, including the immediate release of military prisoners, immunity from punishment for all men who had participated in the strike, and establishing a permanent grievance committee.\n\nThe strike was successful. Over the next few months, many improvements were made: committee members replaced some of the prison guards; prisoners were were given charge of discipline in the kitchen, mess hall, and yard; meat, poultry, butter, and eggs came from a farm from inside the prison; new bathrooms were built; prison officials gave five members of the Prisoners Committee adjudication powers for fellow prisoners accused of breaking basic prison rules.`,

They were also often spontaneous, not easily controlled or planned for by union or factory management.\n\nThe workers began the strike by sending one committee around the plant to call out other departments, another to talk with the boss, and a third to police the shop. Within a day, the entire Plant No. 1 was struck, and after fifty-three hours the workers at Plant No.2 announced they had voted to sit down in sympathy.\n\nManagement gave in completely, and, over the next few weeks, waves of strikes rocked other plants in Akron, most dramatically at Goodyear, where as many as 10,000 workers, including people from all trades in Akron, picketed around the gates of the Goodyear factory.`,

        description: `On this day in 1912, striking worker Anna LoPizzo was shot and killed by police during the Lawrence Textile Strike (also known as the Bread and Roses Strike), one of the most significant struggles in U.S. labor history.\n\nThe Lawrence Textile Strike was a strike of immigrant workers in Lawrence, Massachusetts that began on January 11th, 1912. It was led by the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and united immigrant workers of over forty nationalities. Prompted by a two-hour pay cut corresponding to a new law shortening the workweek for women, the strike spread rapidly through the town, growing to more than twenty thousand workers and involving nearly every mill in Lawrence.\n\nLoPizzo was a striking immigrant worker who was killed when, according to IWW literature, officer Oscar Benoit fired into a crowd of protesters who had been cornered and were being attacked by police. Anna LoPizzo was likely an assumed name; historian Ardis Cameron wrote "relying on old-world practices and principles of collectivity, the immigrant community routinely 'swapped' names and falsified documents to evade 'impossible' laws and ensure mutual survival."\n\nAfter her death, two IWW leaders, "Smiling Joe" Ettor and Arturo Giovannitti, were arrested on fabricated charges related to the murder of a striking worker. Upon their arrest, "Big Bill" Haywood and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn took over leadership of the strike. They further sensationalized the condition of the striking workers by ostentatiously sending their hungry children to stay with families and supporters in New York City.\n\nThe Lawrence Strike was ultimately won by the IWW and strikers. Eugene V. Debs said this of the ordeal: "The Victory at Lawrence was the most decisive and far-reaching ever won by organized labor."`,

The protest, organized by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA), was in opposition to a state policy of internment without trial that was introduced in August of 1971.\n\nOn January 18th, 1972, Prime Minister of Northern Ireland Brian Faulkner banned all parades and marches in response to widespread civil unrest. The march was organized despite this order.\n\nOn the day of the protest, approximately 10,000-15,000 joined the march, however their path was blocked by British Army barriers. The protest descended into chaos, with British soldiers defying orders, chasing down protesters and attacking them indiscriminately. 26 people were shot, and 14 were killed. Many of the victims were shot while fleeing from the soldiers or attending to the wounded, while others were injured by shrapnel, rubber bullets, batons, or being ran down by army vehicles.\n\nThe soldiers were from the 1st Battalion Parachute Army, and had also participated in the Ballymurphy massacre several months prior. The events of Bloody Sunday greatly increased hostilities between Northern Ireland and the British government. Support for and recruitment by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) rose following the massacre.`,

The Justice Department said they could not offer him protection, and so Allen declined to speak out.\n\nDespite this, on the day before Allen planned to move out of state, he was assassinated on his own property.

        description: `James Langston Hughes, born on this day in 1901, was an American author and social activist best known for being a luminary of the Harlem Renaissance. He moved from Joplin, Missouri to New York City as a young man, where he made his career. One of the earliest innovators of the then-new literary art form called jazz poetry.\n\nHughes was a communist sympathizer - his poetry was frequently published in the CPUSA newspaper and he was involved in initiatives supported by Communist organizations, such as the drive to free the Scottsboro Boys, a group of black teens falsely accused of rape. During the Spanish Civil War, Hughes traveled there as a correspondent for the Baltimore Afro-American.\n\nAfter being compelled to testify for a Senate Committee led by Joseph McCarthy, Hughes distanced himself from leftist politics, saying "[My not joining the Communist Party] was based on strict discipline and the acceptance of directives that I, as a writer, did not wish to accept."`,

Martí is also known for co-founding of the Communist Party of Central America, as well as helping lead a communist alternative to the Red Cross known as "International Red Aid".\n\nIn 1931, Martí returned to El Salvador and helped start a guerrilla revolt of indigenous farmers. The Communist-led peasant uprising against dictator Maximiliano Hernández Martínez, fomented by collapsing coffee prices, enjoyed some initial success, but was soon drowned in a bloodbath, being crushed by the Salvadoran military ten days after it had begun. Over 30,000 indigenous people were killed at what was to be a "peaceful meeting" in 1932; this became known as "La Matanza" ("The Slaughter").\n\nFor his role in the uprising, Martí was executed on this day in 1931 by Salvadoran President Hernández Martínez.`,

The New York Times described the crowd like this: "Women shrieked from the windows, the different sections of the crowd hissed and booed and shouted invectives. Fighting began simultaneously in the house and the street".\n\nThe action was part of a larger period of tenant rebellion in 1930s New York City. Beginning in 1930, small bands of people, often led by communists, began to use strong-arm tactics to prevent marshals from putting furniture on the street. Rent riots began in the Lower East Side and Harlem, but quickly spread to other parts of the city.\n\nHistorians Richard Boyer and Herbert M. Morais claimed that these acts of resistance kept 77,000 tenants from being evicted.`,

A large body of men marched to ironworks at Madeley Wood and Dawley, blowing out all the furnaces, damaging machinery, and inciting non-striking workers to join in.\n\nBy mid-afternoon the next day, a crowd of 3,000 had gathered at Old Park, near two industrial spoil heaps known as the 'Cinders Hills'. Yeomanry were sent out to disperse the crowd, and they were read the Riot Act and ordered go home. When Yeomanry moved forward to arrest the ringleaders of the strike, they were assaulted by the crowd. After further attempts to control the protesters were frustrated, the Yeomanry fired onto the crowd, killing two.\n\nNine strikers were arrested - two were sentenced to death and the other seven served nine months of hard labor. The initial dispute which had caused the riot was resolved soon after, with some ironmasters agreeing to reduce the daily pay of the workers by 4d instead of 6d.`,

It was named that because one of the workers' demands was to reduce the workweek from 54 to 48 hours without a reduction in pay.\n\nThe strikers organized themselves among twenty different ethnic groups, with one leader per group. Ethnic store and businesses supported the strikers by accepting coupons in place of cash and the strikers boycotted stores that did not support the strike.\n\nStrikers violently harassed by the police and community - with cops beating and arresting protesters and two strike leaders being kidnapped and taken out of town by unknown assailants. The strike ended on May 20th with workers not only winning the 48 hour work week, but a 15% wage increase as well.`,

During the first two decades of the 20th century, Haywood was involved in several important labor battles, including the Colorado Labor Wars, the Lawrence Textile Strike, and other textile strikes in Massachusetts and New Jersey.\n\nHaywood was an advocate of industrial unionism, a labor philosophy that favors organizing all workers in an industry under one union, regardless of the specific trade or skill level. He believed that workers of all ethnicities should be united, and favored direct action over political action.\n\nHaywood was renowned for leading strikes in times of crisis. When martial law was declared during the Lawrence Textile Strike, Haywood traveled to the strike and implemented many innovative tactics to help the workers involved. One such ploy was to very publicly send the hungry children of striking workers to host families in other states, garnering good press for the working families.\n\nIn 1917, Big Bill Haywood was arrested for espionage, along with 164 other members of the IWW. He was convicted, and, while temporarily released from prison due to an appeal, fled to the Soviet Union, where he served as labor advisor to Vladimir Lenin and spend the rest of life.`,

This and the curbing of labor rights prompted the rest of the workers at La Canadenca to go on strike and demand the readmission of those sacked and wage increases.\n\nThe strike soon spread to other companies in the sector via the CNT's union for water, gas and electricity workers. The lack of electricity in the city affected transport, hampering the provision of supplies and paralyzing 70% of factories in the province of Barcelona.\n\nA state of war was declared by the government and over 3,000 workers were detained. Despite this, the strike ended after two days on the conditions of no repercussions for participating workers, an increase in wages, and, most notably, an 8 hour work day.`,

Dissatisfied workers in several unions began the strike to gain higher wages after two years of World War I wage controls. Government officials, the press, and much of the public viewed the strike as a radical attempt to subvert American institutions.\n\nDuring the strike, a cooperative body made up of rank and file workers from all the striking locals was formed, called the General Strike Committee. It acted as a "virtual counter-government for the city." The committee organized to provide essential services for the people of Seattle during the work stoppage. A system of food distribution was also established, which distributed as many as 30,000 meals each day.\n\nArmy veterans created an alternative to the police in order to maintain order. A group called the "Labor War Veteran's Guard" forbade the use of force and did not carry weapons, and used "persuasion only." Major General John F. Morrison, stationed in Seattle, claimed that he had never seen "a city so quiet and orderly."\n\nImmediately following the general strike's end, the Socialist Party headquarters was raided by police, and thirty-nine IWW members were arrested as "ringleaders of anarchy" despite playing a marginal role in the strike's development.`,

        description: `On this day in 1949, anti-Francoist activist, anarchist, and writer Miguel García, along with 8 others, was sentenced to death by the fascist Spanish government. García (1909 - 1980) was a member of the Tallion Action Group who militantly opposed Franscisco Franco's fascism. His capture came during a brutal crackdown on political dissidents by Spanish security forces in October 1949.\n\nWell known writers and intellectuals, including Andre Breton, Albert Camus, Rene Char, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Ignazio Silone protested the planned executions. There was also support for the nine prisoners from the British Labour Party. For unknown reasons, four of the condemned men, including García, had their sentences commuted to life imprisonment. The other five were executed on March 14th, 1952, in Barcelona.\n\nHere are the names and a brief description of the five executed men:\n\nPedro Adrover Font, aged 44, was a major figure in the Barcelona anarchist resistance who had once placed a bomb under a cathedral in order to assassinate Franco.\n\nSantiago Amir Gruanas ("El Sheriff"), aged 38, was a guide and member of the anarchist resistance who had helped shot-down British airmen, Jews, and French Resistance members from France into Spain.\n\nGines Urrea Pina, aged 56, was a veteran of the Spanish Civil War and advocated for launching a new period of armed resistance against Franco.\n\nJose Perez Pedrero, nicknamed "Tragapanes" ("bread swallower") because he was always hungry, was a miner and had been involved in many guerrilla operations with the anarchist resistance.\n\nJorge Pons Argiles "Tarantula" was a farmer and, like Tragapanes, was involved with the guerrilla activities of the resistance.`,

Claiming that "urgent" action was needed to "bring the French labour market into the modern era", Villepin's CPE package would allow employers to hire 18-26 year-olds on two year contracts and fire them without notice or explanation.\n\nIn response, student unions called for a week of meetings and mobilization, and for a national day of protest for the 7th February. The national protest continued beyond February 7th, however, and a national strike was called on March 28th (incidentally, the same day a million workers in the UK struck to defend their pensions).\n\nHundreds of thousands of workers went on strike, and three million people took to the streets all across the country. Unions were prepared to call another general strike when the French government finally gave in and withdrew the law.\n\nA similar law (the CNE), which applied to small businesses of fewer than 25 people, was eventually overturned in the courts in 2007.`,

The IWW members, along with other radical groups, were often met with opposition (violent and otherwise) from local governments and especially business leaders, in their attempts to exercise their right to free speech.\n\nOn this day in 1912, a San Diego city ordinance that banned giving speeches on the street became effective. It was directly targeted at IWW members, whose street "preaching" became explicitly illegal. The ordinance was met with immediate civil disobedience by labor activists, and several were immediately arrested. Over five thousand IWW members came to San Diego to protest the free speech limitation, and the city's jail capacity was strained.\n\nVigilantes began transporting arrested IWW members to the county border and beat them, and one city official who opposed the ordinance was threatened with lynching. Police indiscriminately used fire hoses on crowds of protesters, including women and children. By the fall of 1912, the protest movement petered out and the Free Speech Fight in San Diego was lost.`,

This would convert traditional systems of land tenure into a state-imposed systems of private property by forcing Native Americans to "assume a capitalist and proprietary relationship with property" that did not previously exist in their cultures. The act declared remaining lands after allotment as "surplus" and available for sale, including to non-Natives.\n\nBetween 1887 and 1934, Native Americans "lost control of about 100 million acres of land" or about "two-thirds of the land base they held in 1887" as a result of the act. The loss of land and the break-up of traditional leadership of tribes produced negative cultural and social effects that have since prompted scholars to refer to the act as one of the most destructive U.S. policies for Native Americans in history.`,

She began the first issue with the words, "In the beginning, woman was the sun", a reference to the Shinto goddess Amaterasu, and to the spiritual independence which women had lost. Adopting the pen name "Raichō" ("Thunderbird"), she began to call for a women's spiritual revolution.\n\nHiratsuka also founded the New Women's Association with fellow women's rights activist Ichikawa Fusae. It was largely through this group's efforts that the Article 5 of the Police Security Regulations (which barred women from joining political organizations and holding or attending political meetings) was overturned in 1922.`,

At the time, 51% Roma women and 72% Roma men were unemployed, a trend which can be traced back to liberalization policies after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In February 2004, the unemployed all over Slovakia received official notices from the government informing them of steep cuts to welfare benefits, and demonstrations broke out in the eastern parts of the country.\n\nThe reaction was a mix of peaceful demonstrations and outright rioting. Signs from protests read "We want work, not food stamps" and "We've had enough of capitalism", and were attended by some of the white ethnic majority.\n\nIn the largest police and military operation since 1989, over 2000 troops were mobilized and sent to the affected regions. On February 23rd, in Trebišov (southeastern Slovakia), police attacked a Roma demonstration with teargas and, in the freezing February cold, water cannon. Early the next morning, around 240 policemen attacked a settlement the protesters were suspected to live in by about 80 people in the historical town of Levoča.\n\nAlthough the protests failed to develop into a more substantive political movement, they had a lasting impact. Soon afterward, the government made important concessions, increasing activation benefits by 50%, introducing scholarships and various subsidies for pupils and students from poor families, and increasing funding for placement opportunities for the unemployed.`,

Following Italy's entry into the war, both D'Andrea and her partner Armando Borghi were subjected to house arrest and legally confined for the duration of the war.\n\nIn 1922, she published her first book of poetry, "Tormento", which included a forward by Italian anarchist Errico Malatesta. A prominent free love advocate and noted anti-fascist, she fled Italy with the rise of fascism and emigrated to the United States. In 1929, a second edition of "Tormento" was published, however the prints were immediately seized by the authorities, who charged that its words "excited the spirits" and inspired revolt.`,

There were also rumors that only four weeks' worth of flour were left.\n\nAt the meeting, an orator initiated the riot by saying this to the gathered crowd: "Fellow citizens! Mr. Hart has now 53,000 barrels of flour in his store; let us go and offer him eight dollars a barrel, and if he does not take it...".\n\nHungry workers plundered private storerooms filled with sacks of hoarded flour and forty people were arrested. The riot was a sign of the impending financial crisis known as the Panic of 1837, that hit the American economy the following month.`,

A major player in the history of coal mining, he was the driving force behind the founding of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), which established the United Steel Workers of America and helped organize millions of other industrial workers in the 1930s.\n\nAfter resigning as head of the CIO in 1941, he took the Mine Workers out of the CIO in 1942 and in 1944 took the union into the American Federation of Labor (AFL). Coal miners for 40 years hailed him as their leader, whom they credited with bringing high wages, pensions and medical benefits.`,

The Nashville sit-ins ended on May 10th, when six downtown stores began serving black customers for the first time.`,

The U.S. military claimed the shelter was a legitimate military target because it fit the profile of a military command center.\n\nSeven Iraqi families living in Belgium who lost loved ones in the attack launched a lawsuit against former President George H.

        description: `From 1933 to 1936, auto factory workers in Akron Ohio frequently engaged in labor strikes and protest. This group was among the earliest to use the effective "sit-down" strike, which involved sitting down on the job and refusing to work as a bargaining measure. On this day in 1936, a large picket strike known as the Akron Rubber Strike began.\n\nThe catalyst for the strike was a round of layoffs that put 700 people out of work a Goodyear plant. Throughout the strike, there were as many as 10,000 workers that picketed around the many gates of the Goodyear factory. Police were unable to enforce an injunction against mass picketing because of the size of the crowd. A private force of about 5,200 people, known as the "Law and Order League", financially funded by Goodyear, and managed by a former mayor of Akron, were prepared to attack the striking workers if told to do so.\n\nThe Summit County Central Labor Council was able to convince the Law and Order League to not attack the striking workers, and violence was averted. The Council also threatened a general strike if there were violent attacks on picketing workers, further dissuading anti-strike attacks. After a month of striking, the workers won their terms and the sit-down strike quickly spread to other parts of the auto industry.`,

The strike quickly grew in proportion - just a few days after it began, more than 80% of the prison population were refusing to work.\n\nThe prison warden declared a "general lockup", which confined all prisoners to their cells, and claimed the strike was over. Despite this, the prisoners considered their protest a victory, as prison work had successfully been stopped, and without the violence of other prison uprisings elsewhere.`,

Although she refused to pay the fine, the authorities declined to take further action. In 1878, Anthony and Stanton arranged for Congress to be presented with an amendment giving women the right to vote.\n\nIt was eventually ratified as the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1920, colloquially known as the Susan B. Anthony Amendment,.`,

They rode with other migrant workers in a pickup truck with a canvas-covered bed, huddling around a can of hot ashes and covering themselves in blankets to stay warm. Velásquez led his first strike at the age of 12, helping pickers at his summer job win better wages.\n\nIn September 1967, Baldemar co-founded FLOC with his father to help migrant workers collectively bargain for better conditions. Through FLOC, Velásquez helped organize strikes and a boycott against the Campbell Soup Company, as well as leading migrant workers on a 560 mile protest march from the union headquarters in Toledo, Ohio to Campbell's headquarters in Camden, New Jersey.\n\nAfter winning a collective bargaining agreement with Campbell's, growers began complaining that they could not compete with inexpensive Mexican produce. Velásquez personally traveled to Mexico and successfully lobbied the Mexican unions to raise their wages and benefits, closing the gap in prices. In 1994, he was awarded the Order of the Aztec Eagle the highest honor Mexico can bestow on a non-citizen.`,

Truman did not respond, and the U.S. began meddling in Vietnamese affairs to undermine Ho Chi Minh's movement. Here is an excerpt from the letter:\n\n"Our Vietnam people, as early as 1941, stood by the Allies' side and fought against the Japanese and their associates, the French colonialists. From 1941 to 1945 we fought bitterly, sustained by the patriotism of our fellow-countrymen and by the promises made by the Allies at [the summits in] Yalta, San Francisco and Potsdam.\n\n...The French aggression on a peace-loving people is a direct menace to world security. It implies the complicity, or at least, the connivance of the Great Democracies. The United Nations ought to keep their words. They ought to interfere to stop this unjust war, and to show that they mean to carry out in peace-time the principles for which they fought in war-time.\n\n...It is with this firm conviction that we request of the United States as guardians and champions of World Justice to take a decisive step in support of our independence. What we ask has been graciously granted to the Philippines. Like the Philippines our goal is full independence and full cooperation with the United States. We will do our best to make this independence and cooperation profitable to the whole world."`,

Together with Seale, Newton created a ten-point program which laid out guidelines for how the African-American community could achieve liberation.\n\nIn the 1960s, under Newton's leadership, the Black Panther Party founded over 60 community support programs (renamed survival programs in 1971) including food banks, medical clinics, HIV support groups, sickle cell anemia tests, prison busing for families of inmates, legal advice seminars, clothing banks, housing co-ops, and their own ambulance service.\n\nThe most famous of these programs was the Free Breakfast for Children program which fed thousands of impoverished children daily during the early 1970s. Newton also co-founded the Black Panther newspaper service which became one of America's most widely distributed African-American newspapers. In 1967, he was involved in a shootout which led to the death of the police officer John Frey. Although arrested for the murder of Frey, the charges were eventually dismissed.\n\nDespite graduating from high school not knowing how to read, he taught himself literacy by reading Plato's Republic and earned a Ph.D. in social philosophy from the University of California at Santa Cruz's History of Consciousness program in 1980. In 1989, he was murdered in Oakland, California by Tyrone Robinson, a member of the Black Guerrilla Family.`,

Immediately after the firings, the union leadership ordered the strike, taking their respective trolley cars off the streets effective at 1:00 that afternoon.\n\nWith the union threatening a general strike to hobble the city if strike breakers were brought in, PRT brought in 600 strike breakers, while denying they had done so. The final straw for calling a general strike was the National Guard entering the city to provide protection for PRT's few remaining workers. Members of other unions throughout the city saw this as a clear signal that the city and state governments were uniting in favor of the companies against the unions, and the entire city began a general strike.\n\nThe tactic was successful, and eventually brought PRT to the negotiating table.`,

Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, authorizing the Secretary of War to prescribe certain areas as "military zones", clearing the way for the incarceration of Japanese Americans, German Americans, and Italian Americans in U.S. concentration camps. By declaring wide swaths of domestic territory as "military zones", they could provide legal justification for forcibly removing people deemed a threat from them.\n\nUsing a broad interpretation of Executive Order 9066, Lieutenant General John L. DeWitt issued orders declaring certain areas of the western United States as zones of exclusion under the Executive Order. As a result, approximately 112,000 men, women, and children of Japanese ancestry were evicted from the West Coast of the United States and held in American concentration camps and other confinement sites across the country.\n\nAmericans of Italian and German ancestry were also targeted by these restrictions, including internment. 11,000 people of German ancestry were interned, as were 3,000 people of Italian ancestry, along with some Jewish refugees. It wasn't until 1990 that surviving internees began to receive individual redress payments and a letter of apology.`,

The next year, it was the number one non-fiction book in the U.S., selling over a million copies. The phrase "feminine mystique" was created by Friedan to illustrate the assumptions that women would be fulfilled from their housework, marriage, sexual lives, and children. Friedan sought to prove that housewives were unsatisfied but could not voice their feelings.\n\nDespite the undeniable importance of the book in feminist history, it has faced numerous criticisms. According to Kirsten Fermaglich and Lisa Fine, "women of color - African American, Latina, Asian American and Native American women - were completely absent from Friedan's vision, as were white working-class and poor women." Some research that the book is predicated on was also later discovered to be fraudulent.`,

In France, the revolutionary events ended the July Monarchy and led to the creation of the French Second Republic. The Second Republic instituted several notable reforms, including universal male suffrage and a guaranteed "right to work", provided by National Workshops who provided the unemployed with a source of income.\n\nOn this day in 1848, crowds of Parisians, angry over the banning of political banquets, flooded out onto the streets to protest against the "Citizen King" Louis Philippe and his chief minister François Pierre Guillaume Guizot. Shouting "Down with Guizot" and "Long Live the Reform", the crowds marched past Guizot's residence and erected barricades in the streets of Paris, where fighting broke out between the citizens and the Parisian municipal guards.\n\nIn the next few days, Guizot resigned and King Phillipp fled the country. On February 23rd, French troops fired into a crowd of protesters, killing 52. By February 26th, the Second Republic had been formed, with poet Alphonse de Lamartine acting as a de facto dictator over France for the next three months.\n\nThe Second Republic's governance would be tested in the "June Days" uprising, which Karl Marx identified as a conflict between petite bourgeoisie and the proletariat. The revolting workers were crushed by force (with over 4,000 insurgents being deported to Algeria) and the Second Republic continued until elected President Louis Napoléon Bonaparte dissolved the parliament in a coup, in 1851.`,

Within a week, strikes had begun in all the shoe towns of New England. Newspapers called it "The Revolution at the North" and the "Beginning of the Conflict Between Capital and labor."\n\nApproximately 20,000 workers went on strike across New England which made it the largest mass walkout in American history prior to the Civil War. It ended in April with modest gains for shoemakers, including pay increases and owner recognition of some labor unions.`,

Du Bois grew up in a relatively tolerant and integrated community, and after completing graduate work at the University of Berlin and Harvard, where he was the first African American to earn a doctorate. He was also one of the founders of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).\n\nDu Bois was a prolific author. His collection of essays, "The Souls of Black Folk", is a seminal work in African-American literature; and his 1935 magnum opus, "Black Reconstruction in America", challenged the prevailing orthodoxy that blacks were responsible for the failures of the Reconstruction Era. Borrowing a phrase from Frederick Douglass, he popularized the use of the term "color line" to represent the injustice of the separate but equal doctrine prevalent in American social and political life.\n\nDu Bois believed that capitalism was a primary cause of racism, and he was generally sympathetic to socialist causes throughout his life. Because of this, he was spied upon by the U.S. government, who eventually indicted him for acting as an agent of a foreign state while advocating for nuclear disarmament. Notably, the NAACP did not support Du Bois during his trial, which ultimately failed to convict him.`,

Comerford and defended by celebrated attorney Clarence Darrow. The trial, which ran from May 10 to August 2, 1920, resulted in convictions for all of the defendants.\n\nLloyd received a sentence of from 1 to 5 years in prison but remained free on bail pending resolution of the appeal process. Though the appeals process was exhausted in 1922, Lloyd was no longer seen as a threatening advocate of communism by that date and his sentence was accordingly commuted.`,

Like other outbreaks of violence in the South in the immediate postwar era, this incident involved military veterans who were unwilling to accept prevailing racial norms upon returning to their hometowns.\n\nIt began when a young white male clerk began harassing the black mother of WWII veteran James Stephenson. Stephenson and the clerk began to fight and the veteran threw the clerk through a window. He and his mother were arrested for disturbing the peace.\n\nThat night, a white mob began to gather outside of the black-owned businesses part of town, called "Mink Side". Rumors were that Stephenson may be lynched, and an armed black crowd began to gather as well. Four policemen tried to enter Mink Side, and, after refusing to heed commands to stop from the black community, were wounded by gunfire.\n\nThe next day, several officers stormed the district, firing randomly into buildings, stealing cash and goods, searching homes without warrants, and took any guns, rifles, and shotguns they could find. When the sweep was over, more than one hundred blacks had been arrested, and about three hundred weapons from the black community had been confiscated.\n\nIn a highly publicized trial, lawyers from the NAACP managed to acquit 23 of 25 blacks of attempted murder charges, and the remaining charges were dropped by prosecutors.`,

The event was also remarkable for its non-violence, given its scale and the time period - only two people died. \n\nUltimately, the strike was not successful in meeting its immediate demands, although the Paterson Silk Strike is regarded as a pivotal event in advancing the 20th century labor movement toward improved working conditions.`,

He was the more radical, pro-Soviet political rival of CPUSA leader Earl Browder, who was a supporter of the Roosevelt administration.\n\nFoster was also a prolific political writer, and his work "Towards Soviet America" has been continuously republished by both leftists and anti-communists who see it as scandalous. Foster described the book as a "plain statement of Communist policy, avoiding technical complexities and theoretical elaboration...Its central purpose is to explain to the oppressed and exploited masses of workers and poor farmers how, under the leadership of the Communist party, they can best protect themselves now...".`,

Williams obtained a charter from the National Rifle Association and set up a rifle club to defend black people in Monroe from Ku Klux Klan, once driving them out of his neighborhood with gunfire.\n\nAfter allowing a white couple to take refuge in their home during race riots, the local police indicted Williams for kidnapping the couple, forcing him to flee the country and take up residence in Cuba as a guest of Fidel Castro. While there, he ran a radio program called "Radio Free Dixie" with Castro support. In 1966 Williams moved to China where he became a friend and advisor to Mao Zedong.\n\nIn 1969, he returned to the United States and adopted more moderate political views. In 1996, Williams died of Hodgkin's Lymphona in Grand Rapids, Michigan.`,

Paul Manhart S.J. and ten other residents of the area were apprehended at gunpoint and taken hostage.\n\nThe rebellion followed the failure of an effort of the Oglala Sioux Civil Rights Organization (OSCRO) to impeach tribal president Richard Wilson, whom they accused of corruption and abuse of opponents. Additionally, the rebels criticized the United States government's failure to fulfill treaties with Native American people and demanded the reopening of treaty negotiations.\n\nThe activists chose the site of the 1890 Wounded Knee Massacre for its symbolic value, and the town was promptly surrounded by nearly one thousand federal agents. Tribal leaders called off the occupation after 71 days, due to the death of a young Lakota man by U.S. sniper fire. The terms of ending the occuption included a mandated meeting at Chief Fools Crow's land to discuss reinstating an 1868 Treaty.`,

        description: `In the late 1930s, sit-down strikes had become prevalent in the auto industry and were particularly effective at winning worker demands. In a sit-down strike, workers stay by their station in the factory but refuse to work it. Factory management was usually reluctant to try and force workers out of the factory for fear of damaging expensive machinery, and often capitulated to them.\n\nOn February 17th, 1937, workers frustrated by failed attempts at getting Fansteel to recognize their union announced a sit-down strike and seized a portion of their factory. The employer won an injunction ordering the union men to vacate the premises, which they ignored, but were ultimately forced out. The NLRB held on March 14th, 1938, that Fansteel had to reinstate 90 of the workers because the company had violated the law first (precipitating the sit-down strike). Fansteel sued the government in response.\n\nOn this day in 1939, the Supreme Court settled National Labor Relations Board v. Fansteel Metallurgical Corporation in favor of Fansteel. The Court held that the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) had no authority to order an employer to reinstate workers fired after a sit-down strike, even if the employer's illegal actions triggered that strike.`,

Berger, born on this day in 1860, was an Austrian-American socialist politician and journalist who was a founding member of the Social Democratic Party of America and its successor, the Socialist Party of America.\n\nBorn in Austria-Hungary, Berger immigrated to the United States as a young man and became an important and influential socialist journalist in Wisconsin, helping to establish the so-called "Sewer Socialist" movement. In 1910, he was elected as the first Socialist to the U.S. House of Representatives, representing a district in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nIn 1919, Berger was convicted of violating the Espionage Act for publicizing his anti-interventionist views and as a result was denied the seat to which he had been twice elected in the House of Representatives. The verdict was eventually overturned by the Supreme Court in 1921, and Berger was elected to three successive terms in the 1920s.`,

Aristide was flown out of Haiti by U.S. personnel, and accounts differ on the nature of his exist. Aristide claims he was kidnapped and told to leave by the U.S. Haitian Embassy's chief of staff under threat of violence, although the U.S. government disputes this claim.\n\nIn the years leading up to the coup, rightwing paramilitary groups violently targeted activists and government officials aligned with the Aristide government. There were also incidents of police brutality against students protesting Aristide's government.\n\nIn the aftermath, Boniface Alexandre succeeded Aristide as interim president and petitioned the United Nations Security Council for the intervention of an international peacekeeping force. Within days, official U.N. troops the combined forces of U.S., Canadian, French and Chilean troops arrived on the island. Aristide was forced into exile in South Africa, although he returned to Haiti in 2011.`,

Although there are no reliable figures for rebel battle losses, historians estimate that from 1,200-2,168 people were executed after the revolt and a similar number were detained in the Solovki Prison Camp.`,

The striking workers sabotaged rail lines and stopped traffic as far away as St. Louis. After two months of protest, the strike was called off on May 4th, without the workers winning their demands. The failure of the strike led directly to the collapse of the Knights of Labor and the formation of the American Federation of Labor (AFL).`,

This form of civil disobedience is known as a "fish-in", and in this case Brando and the clergyman were arrested.\n\nThis fish-in was staged by the National Indian Youth Council, a Native American civil rights organization formed in Gallup, New Mexico in 1961. It became part of the so-called "Fish Wars", a set of protests spanning decades in which Native American tribes around the Puget Sound pressured the U.S. government to recognize fishing rights granted by the Point No Point Treaty.\n\nThe protests eventually won Native Americans in the area the right to fish without state permits - in the 1974 case "United States v. Washington", U.S. District Court Judge George Hugo Boldt stated that treaty right fishermen must be allowed to take up to 50% of all potential fishing harvests and required that they have an equal voice in the management of the fishery.\n\nThe "Boldt Decision" was reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in 1979 and has been used as a precedent for handling other similar treaties.`,

On this day in 1955, she was arrested at the age of fifteen in Montgomery, Alabama for refusing to give up her seat to a white woman on a crowded, segregated bus. This occurred nine months before the more widely known incident in which Rosa Parks, secretary of the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), helped spark the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott.\n\nFor many years, Montgomery's black leaders did not publicize Colvin's pioneering effort. She was an unmarried teenager at the time, and was reportedly impregnated by a married man. It is widely accepted that Colvin was not accredited by the civil rights campaigners at the time due to her pregnancy shortly after the incident, with even Rosa Parks saying "If the white press got ahold of that information, they would have [had] a field day. They'd call her a bad girl, and her case wouldn't have a chance."\n\nColvin left Montgomery for New York City in 1958, because she had difficulty finding and keeping work following her participation in the federal court case that overturned bus segregation (similarly, Rosa Parks left Montgomery for Detroit in 1957). Colvin stated she was branded a troublemaker by many in her community. She withdrew from college and went on to become a nurse in Manhattan.`,

Makhno and thirteen others were sentenced to death by hanging, however Makhno's sentence was commuted to life in prison due to his prior military service.\n\nOn this day in 1917, almost nine years later, Makhno was released from prison as a result of the February Revolution. After returning to Ukraine, he became a key figure in the organization of the "Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine" (also known as the "Black Army"), helping organize and protect an anarcho-communist movement in Ukraine.

In his absence, several leaders were appointed by the men and, on the signal of "Come on the Bolsheviks!", the soldiers began raiding the Quartermaster's Stores, looting sergeant's messes, and setting fires.\n\nWhen 20 of the mutineers were seized, the rest simply charged the guardroom and set them free. Rifle shots were exchanged and three rioters and two guards had been killed. Around 23 were wounded. 78 of the Canadians were arrested and 25 were convicted of mutiny, with sentences of between 90 days detention and 10 years' penal servitude handed out by military courts.\n\nFollowing the riots, priority was given to repatriating the Canadian troops.

        description: `On this day in 1943, nine members of the German anti-Nazi resistance Baum Group were executed by the state, following an arson attack on an anti-Semitic and anti-Communist event prepared by Joseph Goebbels at the Berliner Lustgarten.\n\nThe Baum Group ("Baum Gruppe" in German) was formed by Jewish anti-fascists Herbert and Marianne Baum and their friends Martin and Sala Kochmann after the seizure of power by the National Socialists. Together, they organized meetings dealing with the threat of Nazism, meeting in the residences of various members. Up to 100 youths attended these meetings at various times, engaging in political debates and cultural discussions. The group openly distributed leaflets arguing against National Socialism.\n\nOn May 18th, 1942, the Baum Group set fire to the anti-Soviet exhibit "Das Sowjetparadies" (The Soviet Paradise), held in the Lustgarten in Berlin. The attempted arson was not successful and the exhibition was re-opened the following day. Nine days later, the Gestapo arrested an unspecified number of Jews and incarcerated them in the internment camp at the Lewetzowstrasse Synagogue.\n\nOn March 6th, 1943, nine captured members were executed: Heinz Rotholz (1922–1943), Heinz Birnbaum (1920–1943), Hella Hirsch (1921–1943), Hanni Meyer (1921–1943), Marianne Joachim (1922–1943), Lothar Salinger (1920–1943), Helmut Neumann (1922–1943), Hildegard Löwy, and Siegbert Rotholz (1922–1943). For their part, both Herbert and Marianne Baum were also executed by the state separately in 1942.`,

She was captured and summarily executed by the Freikorps, government-sponsored paramilitary groups consisting mostly of World War I veterans. Her body was thrown in the Landwehr Canal in Berlin.\n\nDue to her pointed criticism of both Leninist and more moderate social democratic schools of socialism, Luxemburg's legacy is a radical, but non-Leninist school of revolutionary socialist thought.`,

It was led by Arthur Scargill of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) against the National Coal Board (NCB), a government agency. Opposition to the strike was led by the Conservative government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who wanted to reduce the power of the trade unions.\n\nThe BBC called it "the most bitter industrial dispute in British history". The number of person-days of work lost to the strike was over 26 million, making it the largest since the 1926 general strike. The journalist Seumas Milne said of the strike, "it has no real parallel - in size, duration and impact - anywhere in the world"`,

The several hundred protesters were making their first of three attempts to march 54 miles, from Selma, Alabama to the state capitol, Montgomery, in protest of voting discrimination and segregationist repression.\n\nThe protest went according to plan until the marchers crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge, where they encountered a wall of state troopers and county posse waiting for them on the other side. The police began assaulting the demonstrators, knocking many to the ground and beating them with nightsticks. Another detachment of troopers fired tear gas, and mounted troopers charged the crowd on horseback. One marcher, a fourteen year old girl, required 28 stiches in the back of her head.\n\nThis assault ended the first attempt of protesters to march to Montgomery, but it brought international attention to the protest. On March 21st, a third attempt was made to march to Montgomery, this one successful and culminating in 25,000 people marching to the State Capitol Building. The protest was a watershed moment in the civil rights struggle, and, by the next year, 11,000 black people successfully registered to vote in Selma.`,

She passed away on this day in 1942.\n\nOne memorable quote of hers reads "My conception of the strike of the future is not to strike and go out and starve, but to strike and remain in, and take possession of the necessary property of production", which was an early anticipation of the sit-down strikes in the U.S. and worker takeovers of factories around the world.`,

        description: `The Citizens' Commission to Investigate the FBI was an activist group that operated in the U.S. during the early 1970s. Their only known action was breaking into a two-man Media, Pennsylvania, office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on this day and stealing over 1,000 classified documents. They then mailed these documents anonymously to several U.S. newspapers to expose numerous illegal FBI operations which were infringing on the First Amendment rights of American civilians.\n\nThe theft resulted in the exposure of the COINTELPRO Program and contained some of the FBI's most self-incriminating documents, including several that detailed the FBI's use of postal workers and switchboard operators to spy on black college students and various non-violent black activist groups. Noam Chomsky has stated that analysis of the stolen documents show that 40% of them were devoted to political surveillance, including two cases involving right-wing groups, ten concerning immigrants, and over two hundred on left or liberal groups.\n\nThe perpetrators were never caught. Over 40 years after the break-in, some participants decided to go public with their story. In 2014, Betty Medsger's book "The Burglary: The Discovery of J. Edgar Hoover's Secret F.B.I." was released, which contains the burglars' description of the burglary and revealed the identities of five of the eight burglars. Filmmaker Johanna Hamilton also made a documentary titled "1971" (2014).`,

The tribal struggle was taken to the courts in "U.S. v.

Batista himself was a candidate in the elections, but was not leading in the polls.\n\nClaiming his actions were necessary to "save the Republic from chaos", Batista, with the backing of the army, stormed the presidential palace, with squads of troops and police surrounding the building. President Prío had left the area 30 minutes before however, and the palace was seized without violence.\n\nThe United States recognized his government on March 27th, and Batista allowed U.S. financial interests (including the mafia) to dominate Cuba's economy. By the late 1950s, U.S. financial interests owned 90% of Cuban mines, 80% of its public utilities, 50% of its railways, 40% of its sugar production and 25% of its bank deposits, approximately $1 billion in total assets.\n\nBatista's reign ended on January 1st, 1959, when he was ousted from power by communist rebels. Early January 1st, 1959, Batista fled with an estimated personal fortune of $300 million to the Dominican Republic, where strongman and previous military ally Rafael Trujillo held power. Batista eventually found political asylum in Oliveira Salazar's Portugal and Francisco Franco's Spain, dying in the latter in 1973.`,

Jogiches was active in both Germany and Poland, founding the political party "The Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland" in 1893, as well as becoming a key figure in the underground Spartacus League in Germany during World War I.\n\nJogiches was also a personal companion and a close political ally of Rosa Luxemburg. After Luxemburg and her political partner Karl Liebknecht were killed by the German Freikorps, Jogiches began investigating their deaths. It is likely for this reason that he was assassinated in Moabit prison on March 10th, 1919, in Berlin.`,

At Auschwitz, Gertner worked in the warehouses at first, sorting the possessions of Jews who had been gassed. There, she met Roza Robota, who was active in the underground resistance.\n\nWhen Gertner was assigned to the munitions factory, she and Roza smuggled gunpowder to the Sonderkommando, who were building bombs and planning an escape. Gertner recruited other women to join the conspiracy and passed the stolen gunpowder to Roza.\n\nOn October 7th, 1944, the Sonderkommando blew up Crematorium IV, but the revolt was quickly quelled by armed SS guards. A lengthy investigation led the Nazis back to Gertner and Roza, and then to Estusia Wajcblum and Regina Safirsztajn, who were also implicated in the conspiracy. They were interrogated and tortured for weeks.\n\nGertner, along with three co-conspirators, were excecuted on January 5th or 6th (sources differ), 1945. This was the last public hanging at Auschwitz.`,

This entry is almost solely reliant on the work of leftist historian Nick Heath (linked below).\n\nA tobacco industry worker by trade Vassev turned to anarchism while serving at the front in World War I, becoming a labor organizer and speaker. Vassev was persecuted for this work, serving time in prison and having to assume a fake identity (he was born Jordan Sotirov, and adopted the name Manol Vassev to escape the authorities). He was also active in the resistance during World War II.\n\nHe was arrested by the Communist for the first time on March 10th, 1945, along with all the delegates to the national conference of the Anarchist Communist Federation at Kniajevo, near Sofia. He was interned at the concentration camp of Dupnitsa and then at Kutzian.\n\nAfter serving five years in prison, a trial was held for a second prison. Held in public, Vassev was accused of being an "agent in the pay of the Anglo-Americans". He interrupted the accusation, stating "It isn't me who signed the Teheran and Yalta treaties with the English and the Americans; it’s not me who went to London to kiss the skirt of the Queen of England!" He died the day before his release was scheduled, poised by the Bulgarian secret police.`,

The learning of Grenada Creole was allowed at school.\n\nIn the health sector, medical consultations were made free of charge with the help of Cuba, which provided doctors, and milk was distributed to pregnant women and children. The government also began setting up a system of financial loans and equipment for farmers, and agricultural cooperatives were being set up to develop the activity.\n\nThe government ruled by decree, having suspended the constitution the previous regime, until a factional conflict broke out, which resulted in Maurice Bishop's exeuction. Ronald Reagan launched an invasion a few weeks later, in October of 1983.`,

It began when two crewmembers seized the vessel with the threat of a bomb and handgun, forcing the master to sail to Cambodia. The ship was under contract with the Military Sea Transportation Service to carry napalm bombs to be used by the U.S. Air Force during the Vietnam War and was originally bound for Sattahip, Thailand. It is the only American mutiny in recent history.\n\nDuring the uprising, 24 of the crew were forced into two lifeboats and set adrift in the Gulf of Thailand while the remainder of the crew were forced to take the ship to a bay near Sihanoukville, Cambodia. The two mutineers had planned to take political refuge in Cambodia, however Prince Sihanouk had just been deposed by a coup the led by the pro-U.S. Sirik Matak and Lon Nol; instead, they became prisoners of the new Cambodian government.\n\nOne mutineer, Alvin Glatkowski, turned himself in at an American Embassy, was extradited to the U.S., and served seven years in prison. The other mutineer, Clyde McKay, escaped capture and sought out the Khmer Rouge regime. He was never captured by authorities, however remains from Cambodia were positively identified as his in 2005.`,

Between 347 and 504 unarmed people were killed by U.S. Army soldiers, including men, women, children, and infants. Some of the women were gang-raped and their bodies mutilated, as were children as young as 12.\n\nDespite two soldiers writing letters to their superiors about the possibility of a war crime having taken place, the U.S. government claimed that the event was a military victory for several months after it occurred. After an independent journalist broke the story and the true nature of the massacre became public, twenty-six soldiers were charged with criminal offenses.\n\nOnly one, Lieutenant William Calley Jr., was convicted. Found guilty of killing 22 villagers, he was originally given a life sentence, but served only three and a half years under house arrest. The incident sparked global outrage and spurred the domestic anti-war movement. Three U.S. servicemen who had tried to halt the massacre and rescue the hiding civilians were shunned and denounced as traitors, including by multiple U.S. Congressmen.`,

        description: `The Paris Commune was a radical socialist and revolutionary government that formed in Paris on this day in 1871. A hotbed of working-class radicalism, the Paris Commune was a watershed moment in revolutionary left history. A few months after it was formed, the commune was attacked and defeated by the French National Army on May 21st, 1871, beginning the so-called "Bloody Week".\n\nThe government of the Paris Commune developed a set of policies that tended towards a progressive, secular, and highly democratic social democracy, although its existence was too brief to implement all of them. Among these policies were the separation of church and state, abolition of child labor, abolishment of interest on some forms of debt, as well as the right of employees to take over and run an enterprise if it was deserted by its original owner.\n\nThe Paris Commune was analyzed by many communist thinkers, most notably Karl Marx, who called it a "dictatorship of the proletariat." Vladimir Lenin danced in the snow when the newly formed Bolshevik government lasted longer than the Paris Commune. It inspired similar revolutionary attempts around the world, including in Moscow (1905), Petrograd (1917), Shanghai (1927 and 1967), and Seattle (2020).`,

Blackwell was also a project director for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and helped organize voter drives for African Americans across Mississippi.\n\nBlackwell was responsible for one of the first desegregation cases in Mississippi, filing a suit, Blackwell v. Issaquena County Board of Education, against the Issaquena County Board of Education after the principal suspended more than 300 black children - including her son - for wearing pins that depicted a black hand and a white hand clasped with the word "SNCC" below them. Although the courts ruled that the students could not wear the pins, they also ruled that the school district in question must desegregate.\n\nBlackwell's son and approximately 50 other children boycotted the school because of its decision to not let the children wear the SNCC freedom pins. As a result, Blackwell and some other activists in the community formed "Freedom Schools" in Issaquena County to resolve the issue. The Freedom Schools were popular and remained open until the school system finally integrated in 1970.`,

That evening a demonstration was held outside the store and, after someone threw a rock through the window, more general destruction of the store and other white-owned properties ensued.\n\nThree black people were killed, 125 people were arrested and 100 people were injured. An estimated $2 million in damages was caused to properties throughout the district, although African American-owned homes and businesses were spared the worst of the destruction.\n\nSociologist Allen D. Grimshaw called the Harlem Riot of 1935 "the first manifestation of a 'modern' form of racial rioting," which he identified with violence being directed almost entirely at property and clashes between black people and police, as opposed to racial groups fighting directly.`,

While studying there, Jingyu read many of Marx's works and became a communist.\n\nIn 1923, Xiang became editor of a weekly supplement to The Republican Daily, a Guomindang newspaper. The same year Xiang Jingyu was also elected as a Central Committee member and became the first secretary of the "Women's Movement Committee". In 1924, she led a strike involving about ten thousand female workers from silk factories. Then, Xiang Jingyu founded the "Committee of Women's Liberation" and trained many female cadres, who then became a force against feudalism and imperialism.\n\nXiang Jingyu was arrested in the French Concession Sandeli in Wuhan on this day in 1928, due to the betrayal of members of her group to the police. The French officials turned her over to the Guomindang in April. On the first of May of that year Xiang Jingyu was executed by Guomindang police.`,

The marches were organized by nonviolent activists to demonstrate the desire of African-American citizens to exercise their constitutional right to vote, in defiance of segregationist repression. By highlighting racial injustice, they contributed to passage that year of the Voting Rights Act, a landmark federal achievement of the civil rights movement.\n\nThe first attempt to make the march happened on March 7th. After attempting to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge, police began assaulting the demonstrators, knocking many to the ground, beating them with nightsticks, and firing teargas. One marcher, a fourteen year old girl, required 28 stiches in the back of her head.\n\nThis assault ended the first attempt of protesters to march to Montgomery, but it brought international attention to the protest. After a federal court ruled that the march was legal, finally, on this day in 1965, a third and successful attempt to march to Montgomery. By its end, 25,000 people marched to steps of the State Capitol Building in Montgomery. The protest was a watershed moment in the civil rights struggle, and, by the next year, 11,000 black people successfully registered to vote in Selma.`,

The movement was an alliance of several independent farming organizations and a multi-racial coalition. It was heavily associated with the People's Party (known as the "Populist" movement).\n\n The Alliance was formed to combat predation of poor farmers by banks and industrialists in a time of economic hardship for the agricultural industry. In 1889, a bushel of corn had lost 80% of its value from a few decades prior, and 90% of southern farmers relied on credit to survive. Around the same time, it boasted over 400,000 members.\n\nThe Farmers' Alliance collectively bargained for equipment prices, formed a statewide cooperative in Texas to handle the selling of equipment, and advocated for government reforms that would ease the financial burden on farmers, introducing more money into circulation in particular. In 1892, their presidential candidate, James Weaver, received over a million votes. After allying with the Democratic Party, the Alliance and the People's Party collapsed in 1896.`,

The program investigated more than three million government employees, just over 300 of whom were dismissed as security risks.\n\nThe order established a wide area for the departmental loyalty boards to conduct loyalty screenings of federal employees and job applicants and allowed the FBI to run initial name checks on federal employees and authorized further field investigations if the initial inquiry uncovered information that cast someone in a negative light.\n\nExecutive Order 9835 also was the main impetus for the creation of the Attorney General's List of Subversive Organizations (AGLOSO). It was later revoked by Eisenhower in 1953, but only to further expand the restrictions in a new executive order (Executive Order 10450). Both executive orders were explicitly repealed by President Bill Clinton (Executive Orders 12968 and 13087).`,

The APL was also accused of illegally detaining citizens associated with anarchist, labor, and pacifist movements. Thousands of APL members joined authorities in New York City for three days of checking registration cards, resulting in more than 75,000 arrests.\n\nThe APL formally disbanded a few months after the conclusion of World War I.`,

Philip Randolph, Roy Wilkins, and Whitney Young). In his autobiography, civil rights leader James Farmer noted that Height's role in the "Big Six" was frequently ignored by the press for sexist reasons.`,

He spoke out against social injustice, assassinations, and torture amid the war between left-wing and right-wing forces. Although initially perceived as a conservative, Romero became an activist after the assassination of his friend and fellow priest Rutilio Grande in 1977.\n\nDuring the civil war, Romero became a prominent figure in El Salvador, giving popular radio sermons in which he listed disappearances, tortures, murders, and much more each Sunday. In a media landscape that was heavily censored, Romero became the source of news for many about what was going on in the country. According to listener surveys, 73% of the rural population and 47% of the urban listened regularly.\n\nIn 1980, Romero was assassinated while celebrating Mass in the chapel of the Hospital of Divine Providence. His funeral was interrupted by smoke bombs and rifle shots from surrounding buildings that were fired into the mourning crowd, killing dozens. Though no one was ever convicted for the crime, investigations by the UN-created Truth Commission for El Salvador concluded that the extreme right-wing politician and death squad leader Roberto D'Aubuisson had given the order to kill Romero.`,

Supporters for the campaign claimed the bombing was necessary to stop a genocide of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and to remove Slobodan Milošević from power, although claims made by the Clinton administration along these lines were later found to be highly exaggerated.\n\nThe bombing campaign killed 1,500 people, approximately 500 of whom were civilians, and damaged hospitals, schools, cultural monuments, and private businesses alongside barracks and military installations. Prominent U.S. critic Noam Chomsky has argued that the main objective of the NATO intervention was to integrate Yugoslavia into the Western neoliberal social and economic system.`,

        description: `The Scottsboro Boys were nine African American teenagers, ages 13 to 19, falsely accused in Alabama of raping two white women on a train in 1931. The landmark set of legal cases from this incident dealt with racism and the right to a fair trial. The cases included a lynch mob before the suspects had been indicted, all-white juries, rushed trials, and disruptive mobs. It is commonly cited as an example of a miscarriage of justice in the United States legal system.\n\nInitially, all but the youngest, 13 year old Roy Wright, were convicted of rape and sentenced to death. With help from the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the case was appealed to the Alabama Supreme Court, which affirmed seven of the eight convictions. The cases were then appealed twice to the United States Supreme Court, which ordered new trials due to the exclusion of black people from juries (Norris v. Alabama) and violation of due process (Powell v. Alabama).\n\nIn the subsequent re-trials, Creed Conyer was selected as the first black person since Reconstruction to sit on an Alabama grand jury. Despite the successful legal appeals, most of the Scottsboro Boys were convicted on charges of rape or sexual assault. The legal aid of the Communist Party impressed some poor black sharecroppers in the South, leading to increased black participation in the party there (Ned Cobb, Hosea Hudson, the Sharecroppers' Union).`,

The act of rebellion began when at least three armed people climbed a high well and entered the guardhouse early in the morning of March 27th, 1993. They subdued the ten guards and locked them in a van near a landfill. After that, the RAF members brought in more than 200 kilograms of explosives, detonating them at 5:12 am. The prison had to be rebuilt, which took another four years, opening and receiving inmates in May 1997.\n\nThe bombing was the last major action of the RAF before they dissolved in 1998.

The incidents became known as the Bydgoszcz Events, and political tensions increased when the Polish government downplayed or outright denied being responsible the injuries sustained by the involved Solidarity members.\n\nSolidarity made several demands, including the immediate punishment of officials responsible for the Bydgoszcz incident, legal permission for peasants to form their own union, annulment of a government directive giving only half pay to strikers, and the closing of all pending cases against people arrested for political opposition to government policies between 1976 and 1980.\n\nIf no agreement between the government and Solidarity could be reached by March 31st, Solidarity planned to instigate a general strike. As a kind of "warning shot" to the state, nearly all Polish workers went on a 4-hour strike on March 27th, 1981. Workers set up guard around occupied factories, and people still on their job wore red and white armbands to express solidarity with those who were striking. During the four hours of protest, television screens in Poland showed the words "Solidarity-Strike"\n\nSolidarity and the Polish government came to an agreement after this episode, and the general strike planned for March 31st was averted. The government conceded to demands about police brutality and admitted mishandling the Bydgoszcz Events. In return, Solidarity leader Lech Wałęsa agreed to postpone the general strike.`,

The bombing was a partial success, destroying 15% of the records, around 800,000 in total.\n\nFollowing the 1940 German invasion and occupation of the Netherlands, everyone aged 15 and older was required to carry an identification card, the "persoonsbewijs", with them at all times. Resistance members soon started to forge identification cards at a large scale – the largest such operation, led by sculptor Gerrit van der Veen, produced some 80,000 forged documents. Forged documents could be easily detected, however, because they could be compared against the records in the civil registries.\n\nDisguised in police uniforms, the resistance group approached the security guards and told them that they had come to search the building for explosives. Believing their story, the guards let them in. Two medical students then sedated the guards by injecting them with phenobarbital. While inside the building, the saboteurs then set the building on fire with a series of timed explosions.\n\nFollowing the bombing, the Nazis immediately offered a 10,000 guilder reward to whomever could identify the perpetrators of the assault. Within a week, most of the conspirators had been betrayed to the Nazis and arrested, including resistance leader and openly gay man Willem Arondeus, who was executed along with twelve others. Arondeus' last words were "Ttell the world that gays are no less courageous than anyone else."`,

Aquash participated in several key events, including the 1973 occupation of Wounded Knee at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, the 1972 Trail of Broken Treaties, and the occupation of the Department of Interior headquarters in Washington, DC.\n\nOn February 24th, Aquash's body was found in Wanblee on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota, murdered by an execution-style gunshot. In his book "In the Spirit of Crazy Horse", Peter Matthiessen writes that the FBI and CIA had previously disseminated rumours that she had been an informant and that Aquash had claimed an FBI agent threatened her life. On the matter, Leonard Peltier stated, "I know that [the FBI's] behavior hasn't changed just as I know that Anna Mae was not an informant."`,

Later blacklisted from the industry for her labor union work, she became a member of the Communist Party USA and a consumer activist.\n\nBefore the shirtwaist strike began, Clara had been listening to men speak about the disadvantages and cautions about the shirtwaist workers going on a general strike at a union meeting. After four hours of this, she rose and declared in Yiddish that she wanted to say a few words of her own. She declared that the shirtwaist workers would go on a general strike, which received a standing ovation from the audience. Clara then took an oath swearing that if she became a traitor to the cause she now voted for, then that the hand she now held high wither from her arm.\n\nThe strike was successful - under a "Protocol of Peace", factory owners and the union agreed to end the strike under improved wages, working conditions, and hours.`,

In October 1931, the Church stated "You cannot be a Catholic and a Communist. One stands for Christ, the other for Anti-Christ". In his Lenten pastoral for 1933, the Bishop of Kildare warned his congregration "be prepared to fight...There is no reason why anyone who undertakes to propagate Communism should be allowed do so".`,

On this day that year, Fred Beal, a communist labor organizer, led a vote among mill workers that was in favor of striking.\n\nOn April 1st, 1,800 mill workers walked out on the job, demanding a 40 hour work week, higher wages, and union recognition. They lived in company homes, and the mill owners promptly had them evicted. Workers created a tent city on the outskirts of town, guarded by armed strikers.\n\nOn June 7th, an altercation between strikers and police led to the police chief being shot to death, and several strikers and police were wounded. In the aftermath, 71 strikers were arrested, and mobs of anti-strike community members harassed and shot at striking workers, killing a young woman. Fred Beal and Clarence Miller, another leader of the strike, were indicted and convicted for the murder of the police chief. Both skipped bail and fled to the Soviet Union.\n\nThough largely unsuccessful in attaining its goals of better working conditions and wages, the strike was considered very successful in a lasting way - it caused an immense controversy which gave the labor movement momentum, propelling the movement in its national development.`,

Ideologically, his world-view combined leftist politics with Roman Catholic social teachings.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Chavez sought to expand the UFW's influence outside California by opening branches in other U.S. states. He also pushed a campaign against illegal immigration into the U.S., which generated violence along the U.S.-Mexico border. Interested in co-operatives as a form of organization, he established a remote commune in the foothills of the Tehachapi Mountains.\n\nA controversial figure, UFW critics raised concerns about Chavez's firm personal control of the union, the purges of those he deemed disloyal, and the personality cult built around him, while farm-owners considered him a communist subversive. For organized labor and leftist groups in the U.S. he became an icon and he posthumously became a "folk saint" among Mexican Americans.`,

This labor conflict ignited during 1891 when coal mine owners in the Coal Creek watershed began to remove and replace their company-employed, private coal miners then on the payroll with convict laborers leased out by the Tennessee state prison system, used in this case as strikebreakers.\n\nCoal workers at the Tennessee Coal Mining Company (TCMC) began their strike on this day in 1891, demanding to be paid in cash, not scrip (currency only usable at company stores) and to be allowed to check the weight of their haul (they were paid by weight, but not allowed to check the company's measurement). On July 14th, armed miners surrounded the stockades where leased convicts were held and sent them by train out of the city.\n\nAfter repeated attacks on mine property and the stockades where the prisoners were being kept, on October 31st, 1891 when the miners finally burned the stockades to the ground and freed the hundreds of convicts being held there. On Nov. 2nd, another band attacked stockades in a different location and freed those prisoners as well. From these two events alone, at least 453 convicts were set free.\n\nThe strike was forcibly put down by state militia, ending with the arrest of hundreds of miners. All but one were either acquitted or merely fined. Tennessee ended its policy of allowing convict labor in 1892.`,

The trial, which began on this day in 1918, was unusual in the way that the prosecution did not try to demonstrate the guilt of individuals, but rather to indict the IWW as an entire organization. During the trial, prosecutors read inflammatory passages from seized documents; accordingly, the defense testified about the plight of the working man and the evils of capitalism.\n\nAll defendants were found guilty on all charges brought by the prosecution, and many IWW members served several years in prison. Among those convicted was the "Big Bill" Haywood, a well-known leader of the IWW, however he skipped bail before his sentencing and fled to the Soviet Union, where he would spend the rest of his life.`,

        description: `The Richmond Bread Riot, which began on this day in 1863, was the largest of several bread riots that took place in the Confederacy during the Civil War. Richmond, Virginia had been suffering an economic crisis in which overcrowding, skyrocketing rent prices, and unaffordable food led to widespread suffering among the poor.\n\nThousands of people, mostly poor women, protested and demanded a meeting with the governor of Virginia. When this meeting was denied, the crowd took the streets, chanting "We celebrate our right to live! We are starving!" and "Bread or blood!"\n\nThey then began attacking government warehouses, grocery stores, and various mercantile establishments, seizing food, clothing, and wagons, as well as jewelry and other luxury goods. Over sixty rioters were arrested, and the Confederacy government censored reporting of the event in the press, for fear it would hurt the morale of the war effort.`,

Malcolm X advised African Americans to judiciously exercise their right to vote, but he cautioned that, if the government continued to prevent African Americans from attaining full equality, it might be necessary for them to take up arms. Here is a brief excerpt:\n\n"I went to a white school over here in Mason, Michigan. The white man made the mistake of letting me read his history books. He made the mistake of teaching me that Patrick Henry was a patriot, and George Washington - wasn't nothing non-violent about ol' Pat, or George Washington. 'Liberty or death' is was what brought about the freedom of whites in this country from the English.\n\nThis is why I say it's the ballot or the bullet. It's liberty or it's death. It's freedom for everybody or freedom for nobody.\n\n...\n\nA revolution is bloody, but America is in a unique position. She's the only country in history in the position actually to become involved in a bloodless revolution. All she's got to do is give the Black man in this country everything that's due him. Everything."`,

Some students in this period chose to campaign for living wages, unionization, and expanded benefits for their campuses' workers, who were often paid significantly less than other university staff.\n\nOn this day in 2000, 24 members of United Student Labor-Action Coalition at Wesleyan (USLAC) marched into Wesleyan's Admissions Office and refused to leave until University President Doug Bennet agreed to pay for the wage increases and benefits that Initial, the contractor used by Wesleyan to employ janitors, declined to provide.\n\nThis action was the culmination of protests and petitions that had not succeeded in changing university policy. Thirty-three hours after the building occupation began, President Bennet contacted Initial, the contractor used by Wesleyan to employ janitors, and offered to pay for a wage increase as well as paid vacations for the school's cleaning staff. Initial agreed and USLAC, declaring victory, ended the sit-in.`,

Öcalan helped found the PKK in 1978, and led it into the Kurdish-Turkish conflict in 1984. For most of his leadership, he was based in Syria, which provided sanctuary to the PKK until the late 1990s.\n\nAfter being forced to leave Syria, Öcalan was abducted in Nairobi in 1999 by the Turkish National Intelligence Agency (MIT) (with the support of the CIA) and taken to Turkey, where he was sentenced to death under Article 125 of the Turkish Penal Code, which concerns the formation of armed organizations. From prison, Öcalan has published several books. Jineology, also known as the science of women, is a form of feminism advocated by Öcalan and subsequently a fundamental tenet of the Kurdistan Communities Union.\n\nÖcalan's philosophy of democratic confederalism, which draws heavily from Murray Bookchin's concept of "communalism", is a strong influence on the political structures of Rojava, an autonomous polity formed in Syria in 2011.`,

In 1926 moved to New York City, settling in Harlem during the Harlem Renaissance.\n\nLater in life, Cooke was an ardent advocate of Angela Davis. She began working with the Angela Davis Defense Committee in 1969 and volunteered as national legal defense secretary of the Angela Davis Defense Fund in 1971.

King is best known for advancing civil rights through nonviolence and civil disobedience, inspired by his Christian beliefs and the nonviolent activism of Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nOn October 14th, 1964, King won the Nobel Peace Prize for combating racial inequality through nonviolent resistance. In 1965, he helped organize the Selma to Montgomery marches. In his final years, he expanded his focus to include opposition towards poverty, capitalism, and the Vietnam War.\n\nFor his activism, he was the target of multiple assassination attempts, arrested 23 times, and surveilled and harassed by the police. In particular, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover harassed Dr. King by making him a target of COINTELPRO, a secret program where FBI agents spied on, infiltrated, and attempted to discredit "subversive" political movements.\n\nIn 1968, King and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference organized the "Poor People's Campaign" to address issues of economic justice. King traveled the country to assemble "a multiracial army of the poor" that would march on Washington to engage in nonviolent civil disobedience at the Capitol until Congress created an "economic bill of rights" for poor Americans.\n\nBefore the plans for the march could come to fruition, however, King was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee while supporting striking black sanitation workers. James Earl Rey was convicted for the murder, but speculation of government involvement has persisted for decades after his death.`,

It was the first of several 20th century Black-led organizations to use the "rainbow coalition" concept.\n\nThe Rainbow Coalition soon included various radical political groups like the Lincoln Park Poor People's Coalition, Students for a Democratic Society ("SDS"), the American Indian Movement (AIM), and the Red Guard Party.\n\nThe Coalition brokered treaties to end crime and gang violence and worked to establish class solidarity across racial lines. On December 3rd, Fred Hampton was assassinated by the Chicago Police Dpeartment, and the Rainbow Coalition effectively dissolved.`,

The group was explicitly revolutionary, eschewing electoralism, and drew recruits from economically alienated youth. In 1970, Wijeweera was arrested following unruly anti-Vietnam War protests in front of the U.S embassy, and JVP launched the 1971 armed rebellion shortly afterward, while its founder was still imprisoned.\n\nThe revolt began on April 5th, 1971 and lasted until June of that year. The insurgents were able to capture and hold several towns and rural areas for several weeks until they were recaptured by the armed forces. The official death toll was listed as 1,200, however other accounts estimate the deaths to be around 4,000 - 5,000 people. The rebellion led to Ceylon severing ties with North Korea, which it accused of supporting the JVP.\n\nIn 1987, the JVP launched another armed rebellion, this one sustained for three years and involving guerrilla warfare and political assassinations. According to Dr. Rohan Gunaratna's research, in this second rebellion, the JVP killed approximately 200 people, including politicians, academics, and military officers, between 1987 and 1990. In contrast, the total death toll of 35,000 - 60,000 is mostly due to violence perpetrated by state-sponsored death squads.`,

The protests were prompted by the Great Depression and corruption in the government of John Squires, the Newfoundland Prime Minister at that time.\n\nThe crowd of approximately 10,000 protesters were demanding a petition to investigate Squires for corruption, however they became unruly when not receiving a response. Some members of the crowd beat down the doors to the Colonial Building, and, when entering it, the police attacked all protesters, inside and outside the building. In response, protesters began throwing objects through windows and attemped to set the Colonial Building on fire. Prime Minister Squires exited the building, but was found by the crowd, who assaulted him and forced him to shelter at a private residence.\n\nSquires immediately resigned - while the riot was still going on - and called new elections. His party, the Liberal Party, won only two seats, with the vast majority going to the United Newfoundland Party. Regardless, this government was dissolved in 1934 and replaced by the Commission of Government, a non-democratic body with representatives chosen directly by the British Government.`,

While participating in the strike, she was clubbed by a policeman after becoming enraged at watching a pregnant women be dragged away by police.\n\nEqui was also a lesbian who maintained a primary relationship with Harriet Frances Speckart (1883 - 1927) for more than a decade. The two women adopted an infant and raised the child in an early U.S. example of a same-sex family. In 1918, Equi was convicted under the Sedition Act for speaking out against U.S. involvement in World War I. She was sentenced to a three-year term at San Quentin State Prison, but was released after ten months.`,

The gathering was called by the governing National Executive Committee of the SPA to make clear the Socialist Party's position on American entry into World War I, although it was controversial whether or not the committee had the authority to do this within the party.\n\nRegardless, the emergency convention ratified the "St. Louis Resolution on War and Militarism", a lengthy and radical document, which reaffirmed the SPA's "unalterable opposition to the war just declared by the government of the United States," branding American entry "a crime against the people of the United States and against the nations of the world."\n\nThe resolution pledged the Socialist Party to "continuous, active, and public opposition to the war, through demonstrations, mass petitions, and all other means within our power" and promised to conduct "consistent propaganda against military training" and "vigorous resistance" to "all reactionary measures," such as conscription, postal and press censorship, and restrictions upon free speech and freedom of assembly. These measures would soon be made illegal with the 1917 Espionage Act, passed later that year.`,

He was the primary instigator of the "Grito de Lares" and is considered to be the father of the Puerto Rican independence movement.\n\nBecause of his abolitionist beliefs, Betances began organizing a series of secret anti-slavery organizations in 1856. Some of these societies sought the freedom and free passage of maroons from Puerto Rico to countries without slavery, while other societies sought to liberate as many slaves as possible by buying out their freedom (this included freeing thousands of slaves as infants and baptizing them at the Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria).\n\nWhile exiled from Puerto Rico, Betances and others formed the "Revolutionary Committee of Puerto Rico" and began agitating for armed insurrection to establish Puerto Rican independence. The most famous attempt of these was the "Grito de Lares", however it was forcibly put down by the local militia.\n\nBetances was known for stating "Nadie puede dar lo que no tiene" (No one can give others what they don't have for themselves) in reference to Spain's unwillingness to grant Puerto Rico or Cuba any reforms.\n\nDays before his death, the U.S. annexed Puerto Rico in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War. Frustrated by the ostensible unwillingness of Puerto Ricans to demand their independence from the United States, he wrote "And what's wrong with Puerto Ricans that they haven't yet rebelled?"`,

Seeing how people on welfare were treated, she organized those on welfare in the housing project, and in 1963 founded ANC (Aid to Needy Children) Mothers Anonymous, which was one of the first grassroots welfare mothers' organizations.\n\nThis organization later became part of the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO), with Tillmon becoming the first chair of the NWRO. In 1972, she became its executive director when George Wiley resigned. Wiley had been trying to mobilize the working poor, whereas Tillmon tried to align with the feminist movement.\n\nTillmon's 1972 essay, "Welfare Is a Woman's Issue," which was published in the women's magazine "Ms.", emphasized women's right to adequate income, regardless of whether they worked in a factory or at home raising children. The National Union of the Homeless used what was called a "Johnnie Tillmon model" of organizing, named after her.`,

Zapata was responsible for defeating and ousting various invading armies from Morelos on multiple occasions.\n\nOn April 10th, 1919, Jesús Guajardo invited Zapata to a meeting, intimating that he intended to defect to the revolutionaries.

Born in Wilkes County, Georgia, he worked as a sharecropper in what was then known as the "Black Belt" of Georgia. Later, Hudson worked as a steel-mill worker and a local union official in Birmingham, Alabama while maintaining an active membership in the Communist Party. Through his work, Hudson was often referred to as a militant fighter against racist oppression and economic exploitation.\n\nDuring the Red Scares of the post-World War II period, Hudson was expelled from the Birmingham Industrial Union Council. In 1947, he was fired from his job, removed from his offices in Local 2815 (which he had founded), and blacklisted as a communist. Hudson told his own story in his book "Black Worker in the Deep South: A Personal Record" (1972).`,

Following the incident, those conservative forces carried out a full-scale purge of Communists in all areas under their control, and even more violent suppression occurred in Guangzhou and Changsha.\n\nBefore dawn on April 12th, nationalist troops began to attack district offices controlled by the union workers. Under an emergency decree, Chiang ordered the 26th Army to disarm the workers' militias. The union workers organized a mass meeting denouncing Chiang Kai-shek the next day, and thousands of workers and students went to the headquarters of the 2nd Division of the 26th Army to protest. Soldiers opened fire, killing 100 and wounding many more.\n\nThis incident marked the beginning of a prolonged purge of communists from the Wuhan province, and the ensuing violence killed over 300,000 people in less than three years. Notably, Stalin sent a telegram to the Chinese communists on June 1st, urging them to organize militarily against the government.`,

Most CIA documentation of the project was destroyed, however 20,000 documents survived because they had been incorrectly stored in a financial records building. We only know of the project today because of this cache and a Freedom of Information Request in 1977.`,

The soviet was formed in the context of the Irish War of Independence, fought between the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and the British government, and was sustained for a period of about two weeks.\n\nThe workers' rebellion began in response to British Army Brigadier Griffin declaring the city to be a "Special Military Area", with permits required for all wanting to enter and leave the city and British Army troops and armored vehicles deployed to the area. On April 11th, a meeting of the United Trades and Labour Council took place where a representative from the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union (ITGWU), Sean Dowling, proposed that the trade unions take over Town Hall and have meetings there.\n\nAfter a twelve-hour discussion and lobbying of the delegates by workers, a general strike was called on April 13th, by the city's United Trades and Labour Council. A special strike committee was set up to print their own money, control food prices, and publish newspapers, and these actions had support from many workers outside the city.\n\nAfter two weeks, the Sinn Féin Lord Mayor of Limerick and the Catholic Bishop Denis Hallinan called for the strike to end. The Strike Committee capitulated, issuing a proclamation on April 27th, stating that the strike was over.`,

The two other rebellions occurred in the Crown colony of Demerara-Essequibo (now part of Guyana) in 1823, and Jamaica in 1831.\n\nThe uprising was led by the African-born slave named Bussa who was born a free West African man, but was captured by slave traders and shipped to Barbados. Bussa and his collaborators began to plan the rebellion when the Barbadian House of Assembly was debating a measure to create a registry for all slaves on the island.\n\nThe uprising began on April 14th, 1816 when slaves burned cane fields in the St. Philip parish, a signal to the rest of the island to began the revolt. Over 70 estates were affected, and white people fled en masse to the capitol for shelter.\n\nThe next day, martial law was declared, and the rebellion was quickly put down by local militia and British imperial troops. In total, 214 people were executed, 170 were deported, and many others were subjected to flogging throughout the entire 80 days martial law was in effect.`,

The anti-fascist tune became the anthem of the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT), and one of the most popular songs of the Spanish anarchists during the Civil War.`,

Although there are records of Quakers condemning the "traffic of Men-body" as early 1688, this group (predominantly but not exclusively Quaker) was the first official organization to work for the abolition of slavery.\n\nThe organization was re-formed in 1784, renamed the "Pennsylvania Abolition Society" (PAS). This version of the group began to grow more influential, broadening its membership to prominent figures as Benjamin Franklin and Benjamin Rush, who both helped write the Society's new constitution.\n\nIn 1787, the PAS unsuccessfully petitioned the Constitutional Convention to institute a ban on slavery. The following year, they successfully lobbied the Pennsylvania legislature to amend the gradual abolition act of 1780, winning reforms like the banning of transporting slave children and pregnant women out of Pennsyvania, as well as outfitting or sending of slave ships from the city. The amended act also imposed heavier fines for slave kidnapping, and made it illegal to separate slave families by more than ten miles.\n\nThe group's influence waned in the decades leading up the Civil War, amid economic crises and an increasing anti-black sentiment. Despite their efforts at gradual abolition, slavery was not abolished in the United States until 1865.`,

It offered $300 per slave forfeited and $100 to any freed slave, on condition that they move to Haiti or Liberia. Dr. John Rock, a black physician in Boston, said this:\n\n"Why talk about compensating masters? Compensate them for what? What do you owe them? What does the slave owe them?

It was written at height of yellow journalism and war fever in the U.S., pushing to intervene in the Cuban struggle for independence against Spain, and urged the working class to not support the coming war. Here is a short excerpt:\n\n"If there is a war, you will furnish the corpses and the taxes, and others will get the glory. Speculators will make money out of it -- that is, out of you.\n\nMen will get high prices for inferior supplies, leaky boats, for shoddy clothes and pasteboard shoes, and you will have to pay the bill, and the only satisfaction you will get is the privilege of hating your Spanish fellow-workmen, who are really your brothers and who have had as little to do with the wrongs of Cuba as you have."`,

Covertly financed and directed by the U.S. government, the operation took place at the height of the Cold War and its failure led to major shifts in international relations between Cuba, the United States, and the Soviet Union.\n\nThe coup attempt came in response to Castro expropriating property from American businesses, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower allocated $13.1 million to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in March 1960 for use against Castro. With the aid of Cuban counter-revolutionaries, the CIA proceeded to organize the invasion.\n\nOn the night of April 17th, the an invasion force of about 1400 Cuban exiles and CIA officers landed on the beach at Playa Girón in the Bay of Pigs. After a few days, they became overwhelmed by the Cuban army when Kennedy refused to provide air support that was deemed necessary by the CIA.\n\nThe invasion's defeat solidified Castro's role as a national hero and strengthened Cuba-Soviet relations. Several Cuban exiles and two Americans were executed upon capture; over 1000 prisoners were exchanged for humanitarian aid from the U.S. government.`,

The event was a culmination of years of activism at Harvard to try and get the richest university in the world to pay all of its workers a living wage.\n\nThe sit-in ended after 21 days (the longest in Harvard history) when Harvard President Neil L. Rudenstine announced the formation of a University-wide committee to investigate the "principles and policies" regarding low paid and contract university workers. No non-unionized or non-management workers served on the committee, and those that did were outnumbered 3-1 by faculty and students.`,

The confrontation directly caused perhaps fifty violent deaths from armed conflicts between miners and strike-breaking forces, as well as many more deaths indirectly caused by starvation and malnutrition among the striking miners.\n\nIn terms of casualties, it was among the worst conflicts in American labor union history.`,

The Colorado National Guard and Colorado Fuel and Iron Company guards attacked a tent colony of 1,200 striking coal miners and their families in Ludlow, Colorado, on April 20th, 1914, with the National Guard using machine guns to fire into the colony.\n\nApproximately 21 people, including miners' wives and children, were killed. The chief owner of the mine, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., was widely excoriated for having orchestrated the massacre. In retaliation for the massacre at Ludlow, the miners armed themselves and attacked dozens of anti-union establishments over the next ten days, destroying property and engaging in several skirmishes with the Colorado National Guard along a 40-mile front from Trinidad to Walsenburg.\n\nAn estimated 69 to 199 deaths occurred during the strike. Historian Thomas G. Andrews has called it the "deadliest strike in the history of the United States", and the entire series of events is commonly known as the Colorado Coalfield War. Although the strikers' demands were not met, the event electrified national discussions of labor and had a positive impact on labor rights in the long run.`,

This was the case despite there being no evidence of Spanish involvement in the explosion.\n\nThe outcome of the war resulted in U.S. acquisition of Puerto Rico, Cuba, and the Philippines, and signaled a new era of American expansionism and colonialism in the 20th century.\n\nFrom 1899-1901, the U.S. had to brutally suppress the Filipino movement for independence, killing between 200,000 and 1,000,000 civilians in the Philippine-American War. In 1901, the American government refused to withdraw troops from Cuba unless their Constitutional Convention signed the Platt Amendment, which gave the U.S. government and capital de facto hegemony over newly independent Cuba.`,

Under his administration, Russia and then the wider Soviet Union became a one-party communist state governed by the Russian Communist Party. Ideologically a communist, he developed a variant of Marxism known as Leninism.\n\nWidely considered one of the most significant and influential figures of the 20th century, Lenin was the posthumous subject of a pervasive personality cult within the Soviet Union until its dissolution in 1991. He became an ideological figurehead behind Marxism-Leninism and thus a prominent influence over the international communist movement.\n\nA controversial and highly divisive historical figure, Lenin is viewed by supporters as a champion of socialism and the working class, while critics on both the left and right emphasize his role as founder and leader of an authoritarian regime responsible for political repression and mass killings.`,

The conscription measures enjoyed a coalition of opposition - unions, Irish nationalists, and the Catholic Church all supported resisting the measure.\n\nOn April 18th, an Anti-Conscription Committee representing a variety of political factions convened to develop methods for resisting conscription. On the same day, Roman Catholic bishops held a meeting and declared the conscription decree unjust, and called on the Church's adherents to resist "by the most effective means at our disposal".\n\nIn the weeks following the April 23rd strike, anti-conscription rallies were held nationwide, with 15,000 people attending a meeting in County Roscommon at the start of May. Despite the conscription law's passage, it was never put in effect - no one in Ireland was drafted into the British Army.`,

On April 23rd, the principal was lured off campus, the students convinced the teachers to leave, and, in the school auditorium, the students agreed to stage a walk-out. This act led to a lawsuit which was one of five cases considered in Brown v. Board of Education (1954), which resulted in segregation being declared unconstitutional.\n\nAfter the ruling, rather than desegregate, the Prince Edward County Board of Supervisors refused to appropriate money from the county school board to the public schools. This refusal, which continued for five years, was part of the "Massive Resistance Movement", a Virginia state government policy to block the desegregation of public schools. The school - Robert Russa Moton High School - is now a civil rights museum.`,

The Rising was launched by Irish republicans to end British rule in Ireland and establish an independent Irish Republic while the United Kingdom was fighting the First World War. It was the most significant uprising in Ireland since the rebellion of 1798 and the first armed action of the Irish revolutionary period.\n\nThe rebellion was a collaboration of multiple militant Irish organizations, including the Irish Volunteers, the Irish Citizen Army, and Cumann na mBan, an Irish women's paramilitary force. Notable leaders include schoolmaster and Irish language activist Patrick Pearse and socialist James Connolly. Together, they seized strategically important buildings in Dublin and proclaimed an Irish Republic.\n\nThe Easter Rising lasted for six days and killed nearly 500 people, wounding 2,600 more. Sixteen of the Rising's leaders were executed in May 1916, but the insurrection, the nature of the executions, and subsequent political developments ultimately contributed to an increase in popular support for Irish independence.`,

He is also a journalist with Prison Radio. After numerous appeals, his death penalty sentence was overturned by a Federal court. In 2011, the prosecution agreed to a sentence of life imprisonment without parole. He entered the general prison population early the following year.`,

Another election was held in 1976 and the first constitutional government, led by center-left socialist Mário Soares, took office.`,

Without consulting the rest of the group, she went and sat down in the jetway and refused to move. The delegation were given seats on that flight.\n\nIn January 1967, her health began to decline precipitously around the same time as the splintering of SNCC and she was admitted to a hospital. She suffered for ten months from a rare blood disease and in April of that year she was diagnosed with terminal cancer. She died on October 7th, 1967, aged 25.`,

The Justice Department said they could not offer him protection, and so Allen declined to speak out.\n\nDespite this, on the day before Allen planned to move out of state, he was assassinated on his own property. In 2011, the CBS program "60 Minutes" conducted a special on his murder which suggested that Allen was killed by Amite County Sheriff Daniel Jones. No one has been prosecuted for his murder.`,

It began in the wake of the 1845 U.S. annexation of Texas, which Mexico still considered Mexican territory. The war was part of President James K. Polk's vehemently expansionist policy - he had campaigned on annexing both Texas and California, land that was claimed by the Mexican government at the time, by force, if necessary.\n\nTensions had already been rising between either government, but the act that initiated the war was Polk ordering troops to occupy contested land, between the Nueces River and Rio Grande. On this day in 1846, a 2,000-man Mexican cavalry detachment attacked a 70-man U.S. patrol under the command of Captain Seth Thornton in the area of contested land.\n\nPolk asserted that American blood had been shed on American soil (which Abraham Lincoln called it "a bold falsification of history"), and a formal declaration of war from the U.S. soon followed. The outcome of the war resulted in the U.S. acquiring control over Texas, California, and large parts of New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, Utah, and Nevada in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Notably, an "All-Mexico Movement" in the U.S. opposed the treaty, demanding that the country annex all Mexican territory.`,

When they arrived and demanded Rhee's resignation, police opened fire on protestors killing approximately 180 and wounding thousands. A week later, professors joined students and citizens in large-scale protests in which police refused to attack the protesters.\n\nThe next day, Rhee resigned and fled the country and found asylum in Hawaii. On May 16th, 1961, following months of political instability, General Park Chung-hee launched a coup d'état overthrowing the short-lived Second Republic of South Korea and replacing it with a military junta and later the autocratic Third Republic of South Korea.`,

It was based in Bradford, West Yorkshire, and primarily made up of South Asian and West Indian-descended young people.\n\nOn June 30th, 1981, twelve members of the league were arrested in Bradford after a police raid found them in possession of thirty eight milk bottles filled with petrol. The members claimed that they were a preemptive self-defense measure against the possibility of attacks from white power skinhead gangs and National Front members, however they were charged with a conspiracy to attack the police.\n\nDuring their trial, the prosecution argued that "there was no threat in the black community from fascists", however this assertion was debunked during the proceedings with documented evidence of racist attacks. All twelve UBYL members were acquitted, and the ruling established a precedent that marginalized communities could arm themselves in self-defense.`,

The Black Sea Mutiny was a set of revolts by sailors who had been dispatched to the Black Sea as part of the French, pro-White Army intervention in southern Russia.\n\nAlthough some of the crew already had radical politics, the impetus for outright rebellion came when the sailors learned that André Marty, a communist prisoner from another ship, had been brought on board. A crew-led revolutionary action committee aimed both to free Marty and to take the ship into the port of Odessa, Ukraine.\n\nWhen the ship's captain appealed to the "national interest" as a means of quelling the revolt, the soldiers replied "No and never. It's not our job to defend the millions of French capitalists!". The mutineers threatened to give the ship over to the Bolsheviks if they were not returned to France immediately.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Black Sea Mutiny, which included several ships besides the Waldeck-Rousseau, about 100 sailors were sentenced by French military tribunals, although the majority were rapidly reprieved. For his part, Marty to 20 years forced labor, however he became a leading and successful figure in the French Communist Party (PCF) for nearly thirty years, joining the National Assembly in 1924.`,

The strike action came after a big economic boom in Denmark that left workers feeling left out from the increased profits of their employers.\n\nThe strike effected a wide variety of industries - from schools to manufacturing to airports to food and petrol stations. Workers in Sweden exhibited solidarity by refusing to load planes heading for Denmark.\n\nMay Day marked the fifth day of the strike, and a gigantic demonstration of more than 500,000 people took place in Copenhagen. The government intervened, ordering everyone back to work on May 11th and announcing that any strikes by the affected workers before March 2000 would be illegal.\n\nA compromise deal was accepted by union leadership, and the majority of strikers returned to work, however some spontaneous walk-outs occurred in the following days - in 96 workplaces, 6,200 workers walked out for a one-day strike. Notably, baggage handlers at Copenhagen International Airport stopped making their contributions to the Social Democratic Party, which led the government throughout the labor action.`,

Mussolini had ruled Italy as "Il Duce" since 1925\n\nMussolini's grip on power had begun slipping as the Allies pressed into Italian territory during World War II. On April 25th, 1945, Mussolini attempted to flee Milan for Switzerland after the Comitato di Liberazione Nazionale Alta Italia (Committee of National Liberation for Northern Italy) seized control of the city. Two days later, Mussolini, along with other fascist leaders, were arrested traveling in a German convoy near the village of Dongo.\n\nAccounts vary on how exactly Mussolini was killed, but it is likely that communist partisan Walter Audisio was the person behind the trigger. Regardless, that evening, the bodies of Mussolini, his mistress, and the other executed fascists were loaded onto a van and dumped in Piazzale Loreto, a town square where fifteen partisans had been executed by fascists and their bodies left on public display.`,

Although Trujillo brutally suppressed the population, his anti-communism made him a natural ally of the U.S. govenrment. After his death, liberal reformer Juan Bosch became president, both was deposed in a coup after less than a year in power.\n\nIn the ensuing power struggle, the U.S. was committed to preventing "another Cuba" (i.e., a communist revolution) from taking place. On April 28th, 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson declared that he had taken action to forestall the establishment of a "communist dictatorship" in the country, providing reporters with lists of suspected communists there as evidence. These lists, however, contained people who were not communists or were in fact deceased.\n\nThe military action was supported by the Organization of American States (OAS). Over the next few weeks, they established a conservative, non-military government, which held fraudulent elections in June 1966. 69% of American people approved of the decision to send in troops at the time.\n\nAccording to Rory Fanning of Jacobin: "Upon taking power, U.S.-backed leader Joaquín Balaguer began funneling nearly all of Dominican Republic's minerals and sugar into the warehouses of US businesses. His three-decade rule was marked by corruption and fraud. Wages plummeted, unions were dismantled, inflation soared, and unemployment hovered around 30 percent."`,

At each stop through Burke Canyon, more miners climbed aboard, eventually numbering over one thousand.\n\nUpon arriving at the mine, the men carried three thousand pounds (1,400 kg) of dynamite into the mill and detonated it, completely destroying the mill. The group also burned down the company office, the boarding house, and the home of the mine manager. The miners re-boarded the "Dynamite Express" and returned the way they came.\n\nState authorities used federal troops to commit mass arrests - over 1,000 men were rounded up and put into a "bullpen.", included some elected officials and at least one sheriff.

The action was led by four young West Indian men, Roy Hackett, Owen Henry, Audley Evans and Prince Brown, who formed an action group later known as the "West Indian Development Council". Unhappy with the lack of progress in fighting discrimination by the West Indian Association and inspired by Montgomery bus boycott in the United States, the activists decided on a bus boycott in Bristol to win their rights.\n\nThe boycott drew national attention to racial discrimination in Britain, and continued for several months. The boycott was finally resolved on August 27th, 1963, when a mass meeting of 500 bus workers agreed to officially put an end to the "colour bar". On September 17th, Raghbir Singh, a Sikh, became Bristol's first non-white bus conductor.\n\nThe Bristol Bus Boycott is considered by some to have been influential in the passing of the Race Relations Act 1965 which made "racial discrimination unlawful in public places" and the Race Relations Act 1968, which extended the provisions to employment and housing.`,

        description: `International Workers' Day, also known as Labor Day or May Day, is a celebration of laborers and the working classes that is promoted by the international labor movement, and occurs every year on this day. The date was chosen in 1889 by the Second International to commemorate a notable campaign for the eight-hour day, which culminated in the deadly Haymarket Affair in Chicago on May 4th, 1886. May Day subsequently became an annual event.\n\nThe Haymarket Affair began with a general strike that demanded an eight-hour day. On May 4th, the police acted to disperse a public assembly in support of the strike when an unidentified person threw a bomb. The police responded by firing on the crowd of protesters. The ensuing violence led to the deaths of seven police officers, four to eight civilians, and wounded approximately one hundred people on either side.\n\nHundreds of labor leaders and sympathizers were later rounded-up and four were executed by hanging after conviction in a trial widely perceived as a miscarriage of justice. The following day in Milwaukee Wisconsin, state militia fired on a crowd of strikers killing seven, including a schoolboy and a man feeding chickens in his yard.`,

The racial violence was ignited by political, social, and racial tensions following the American Civil War, in the early stages of Reconstruction.\n\nThe violence began when a large group of black Union veterans, women, and children gathered in the street, forming an impromptu street party. Police were sent to disperse the crowd, and, after the ex-soldiers refused to disperse, The four officers, being outnumbered, retreated and called for reinforcements. The soldiers gave chase and gunfire broke out, killing one cop.\n\nThis led to mobs of white residents, including policemen, firefighters, and city officials, rampaging through black neighborhoods and the houses of freedmen, attacking, raping, and killing black soldiers and civilians. Families were burned alive as their houses were set on fire and the mob prevented them from fleeing. In total, 46 black and 2 white people were killed, 75 persons injured (mostly black), over 100 robbed, and 5 black women testified they were raped.`,

Mitchell Palmer).\n\nCPUSA was an early opponent of segregation and racial discrimination, giving legal aid to the Scottsboro Boys and helping poor black farmers in the South organize into sharecropper unions. Because of this, the party had a strong presence in Alabama in the 1930s.\n\nCPUSA's unwavering support for the Soviet Union alienated other factions of the American left and made it subject to significant political persecution during the Cold War; its membership declined significantly after World War II.`,

When six Panthers entered the assembly chamber, where the lawmakers in session, some legislators reportedly took cover under desks. Police then ordered the Panthers to leave the premises, and they peacefully complied while insisting they were within their legal right to carry.\n\nOutside, Bobby Seale spoke to a crowd of reporters. Here is a small excerpt of what he said:\n\n"Black people have begged, prayed, petitioned, demonstrated, and everything else to get the racist power structure of America to right the wrongs which have historically been perpetuated against black people. All of these efforts have been answered by more repression, deceit and hypocrisy. As the aggression of the racist American government escalates in Vietnam, the police agencies of America escalate the oppression of black people throughout the ghettoes of America."\n\nShortly after Seale finished speaking, police arrested the group on felony charges of conspiracy to disrupt a legislative session, although the protesters would later plead guilty to various misdemeanors.`,

After the university was closed on May 2nd, the tensions escalated. On May 6th, more than 20,000 students, teachers, and supporters engaged in a protest march. The march was attacked by police and devolved into a riot.\n\nThe state repression of protesters caused two major left union federations, the Confédération Générale du Travail (CGT) and the Force Ouvrière (CGT-FO), to call a one-day general strike on May 13th. More than one million people demonstrated that day.\n\nBy the middle of May, demonstrations had extended to factories, though demands there were different from the students'. Across France, students occupied university structures and up to one-third of the country's workforce was on strike.\n\nThe protests reached such a point that political leaders feared civil war or revolution. President Charles de Gaulle secretly fled France to Germany at one point, and the national government at times ceased to function.\n\nRevolution was averted when de Gaulle dissolved the National Assembly and scheduled an election that the left dissidents agreed to participate in. Revolutionary fervor subsided and the government banned a number of leftist organizations. In the electon, de Gaulle's party won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history, taking 353 of 486 seats versus the Communists' 34 and the Socialists' 57.`,

Punishment for the strike fell disproportionately on black workers, with five of the seven fired workers being black despite whites participating in the labor action.\n\nIn response to this and discrimination within the plant - black workers were kept in the lowest-paying and most dangerous jobs, passed over for promotion, and the United Auto Workers union (UAW) would not help them combat discrimination - DRUM was formed to organize the black workers at the company.\n\nIn July, DRUM called for another shutdown of the plant and, this time, more than 3,000 black workers participated in the strike, keeping it closed for over two days. Their success inspired the formation of other Revolutionary Union Movements in other Michigan auto plants and industries, such as FRUM (Ford), CADRUM (GM's Cadillac plant), and GRUM (the larger GM caucus), healthcare workers (HRUM), and UPS workers (UPRUM).\n\nFrom these organizations, seven activists organized the various -RUMs into one umbrella organization with a socialist bent - the League of Revolutionary Black Workers (LRBW). The LRBW sought to transform the UAW from within, eventually compelling the UAW to hire black people into leadership positions.`,

It was led by affluent lawyer Thomas Wilson Dorr, who mobilized the disenfranchised to demand changes to the state's electoral rules.\n\nIn 1841, the movement held a "People's Convention", where they designed their own state constitution, ratifying it and electing Dorr for governor the following year. Despite protests from Dorr and others, this constitution still would have only enfranchised whites.\n\nOn this day in 1842, the Dorr movement held an inauguration parade of working class people in support of Dorr. Dorr himself led a fiasco of an attack on the state arsenal, and quickly fled the state. Eventually, Dorr returned to the state and was arrested and convicted of treason.\n\nDorrites made a case to the Supreme Court that the "People's Convention" constitution was the legitimate one for Rhode Island, but lost the case in Luther v. Borden. Notably, this Supreme Court case set a long standing precedent that the Court would not interfere in "political" questions, which it would leave to the executive and legislative branches.`,

The next day, the Nixon administration canceled the protester's permit and police, dressed in riot gear, raided the encampment, firing tear gas and knocking down tents.\n\nOn this day, President Nixon executed "Operation Garden Plot" (a plan it had developed during the 1960s to combat major civil disorders), deploying 10,000 federal troops to various locations in the Washington, D.C. area.\n\nWhile the troops secured the major intersections and bridges, police roamed through the city making massive arrest sweeps and used tear gas. By eight in the morning, police had detained over 7,000 people, arresting anyone who looked like a demonstrator, including construction workers who had come out to support the government. Over the course of several days, the city arrested 12,614 people, making it the largest mass arrest in U.S. history.`,

The POUM, the Friends of Durruti Group, the Bolshevik-Leninists and the Libertarian Youth took positions, and, after a few hours, all political parties had taken out the weapons they had hidden and began building barricades.\n\nFrom this skirmish, battles began in different parts of the city. Several hundred barricades were built and police units occupied roofs and church towers. The fighting continued for several days and Assault Guards in Barcelona, Tarragona and other many towns proceeded to disarm and arrest numerous members of the CNT, FAI, Libertarian Youth and POUM that had taken part in the riots.

They shouted such slogans as "struggle for the sovereignty externally, get rid of the national traitors at home", "do away with the Twenty-One Demands", and "don't sign the Versailles Treaty".\n\nThe next day, students in Beijing as a whole went on strike and in the larger cities across China, students, patriotic merchants, and workers joined protests. The demonstrators skillfully appealed to the newspapers and sent representatives to carry the word across the country. In Shanghai, a general strike of merchants and workers nearly devastated the entire Chinese economy.\n\nIn the years that followed, many Chinese political thinkers turned to leftist politics in the wake of the political upheaval of the May 4th Movement.

The bomb blast and ensuing gunfire resulted in the deaths of seven police officers, four to eight civilians, and wounded approximately one hundred people on either side.\n\nIn the internationally publicized legal proceedings that followed, eight anarchists were convicted of conspiracy. Seven were sentenced to death and one to a term of 15 years in prison. Illinois Governor Richard J. Oglesby commuted two of the sentences to terms of life in prison; another committed suicide in jail rather than face the gallows. The other four were hanged on November 11th, 1887.\n\nAmong supporters of the labor movement in the United States and abroad and others, the trial was widely believed to have been unfair, and even a serious miscarriage of justice.

        description: `On this day in 1961, the first Freedom Ride left Washington, D.C., headed for New Orleans, Louisiana. Freedom Riders were civil rights activists who rode interstate buses into the segregated Southern United States in 1961 and subsequent years to challenge the Southern non-enforcement of the United States Supreme Court decisions Morgan v. Virginia (1946) and Boynton v. Virginia (1960), which ruled that segregated public buses were unconstitutional.\n\nParticipants journeyed to the deep South, including women as well as men and testing segregated bus terminals as well. The riders were met with severe violence. In Anniston, Alabama, one of the buses was fire-bombed and passengers were beaten by a white mob. White mobs also attacked Freedom Riders in Birmingham and Montgomery. The violence garnered national attention, sparking a summer of similar rides by CORE, SNCC and other Civil Rights organizations and thousands of ordinary citizens.`,

The killings took place during a peace rally against the expanding involvement of the Vietnam War into neutral Cambodia by United States military forces as well as the National Guard presence on campus.\n\nOn May 4th, an estimated 2,000 people gathered on the university's Commons, near Taylor Hall. After the National Guard attempted to disperse the crowd, armed guardsmen began firing on the protesters. Four students were killed and nine were wounded, nearly all more than two hundred feet away from the guardsmen.\n\nThe Kent State Massacre marked the first time that a student had been slain in an anti-war gathering in United States history. Just ten days after the Kent State shootings, however, two students were killed (and 12 wounded) by police at Jackson State University in Mississippi.`,

His best-known works are the "The Communist Manifesto" and the three-volume "Das Kapital". His political and philosophical thought had enormous influence on subsequent intellectual, economic and political history, and his name has been used as an adjective, a noun and a school of social theory.\n\nMarx's critical theories about society, economics and politics - collectively understood as Marxism - hold that human societies develop through class conflict. In capitalism, this manifests itself in the conflict between the ruling classes (known as the bourgeoisie) that control the means of production and the working classes (known as the proletariat) that enable these means by selling their labor power in return for wages. \n\nEmploying a critical approach known as historical materialism, Marx predicted that, like previous socio-economic systems, capitalism produced internal tensions which would lead to its self-destruction and replacement by a new system known as socialism.`,

The Communist-led peasant uprising against dictator Maximiliano Hernández Martínez, fomented by collapsing coffee prices, enjoyed some initial success, but was soon drowned in a bloodbath, being crushed by the Salvadoran military ten days after it had begun. Over 30,000 indigenous people were killed at what was to be a "peaceful meeting" in 1932; this became known as "La Matanza" ("The Slaughter").\n\nFor his role in the uprising, Martí was executed by Salvadoran President Hernández Martínez.`,

When fascists seized power in Italy, Camillo was a militant dissenter, active with the Union of Italian Anarchists. In May 1926, Berneri became a political refugee, fleeing to France with his family.\n\nWhen the Spanish Civil War broke out, Berneri rushed to Catalonia, the center of a revolution spearheaded by the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT). Together with Carlo Rosselli, he organized the first column of Italian volunteers to fight on the Aragon front, which were incorporated into the militia column of Joaquín Ascaso.\n\nOn this day in 1937, Camillo Berneri and his anarchist friend Francesco Barbieri were taken out of their apartment by a dozen plainclothes men with red armbands and policemen. The corpses of the two Italian anarchists were later found riddled with bullets. It is speculated that the Soviet Union, which suppressed anarchist movements in Spain, was responsible for the killings.`,

Over a five-year period, Herndon's case twice reached the United States Supreme Court, which ruled that Georgia's insurrection law was unconstitutional, as it violated First Amendment rights of free speech and assembly.\n\nHerndon became nationally prominent because of his case and his defense attorney, Benjamin Davis, was radicalized because of it. He is also remembered for his essay entitled "You Cannot Kill the Working Class". By the end of the 1940s, he left the Communist Party and moved to the Midwest, living there quietly.`,

Before the IWW, the only union in place for hotel workers only had about 2,000 members and prohibitively high membership dues.\n\nThe workers demanded at least one day off a week, a higher minimum wage, and a prohibition of discrimination for being in a union. The strike continued through the rest of May but faced repression from the police. The strike officially ended on June 25th, 1912 without legal recognition for the IWW created Hotel Workers' International Union. Despite this failure, hotel workers would go on strike again in 1913, 1918, 1929, and 1934.`,

He was dissatisfied with the pacifism of the organized abolitionist movement: "These men are all talk. What we need is action - action!"\n\nIn October 1859, Brown led a raid on the federal armory at Harpers Ferry, Virginia (today West Virginia), intending to start a slave liberation movement that would spread south through the mountainous regions of Virginia and North Carolina. He seized the armory, but seven people were killed, and ten or more were injured. Brown intended to arm slaves with weapons from the armory, but only a small number of local slaves joined his revolt. Within 36 hours, those of Brown's men who had not fled were killed or captured by local farmers, militiamen, and U.S. Marines, the latter led by Robert E. Lee.\n\nBrown was hastily tried for treason against the Commonwealth of Virginia, the murder of five men, and inciting a slave insurrection; he was found guilty on all counts and was hanged. He was the first person executed for treason in the history of the United States.`,

The riot left between 22 and 31 rioters dead, and more than 120 people injured. It was the deadliest to that date of a number of civic disturbances in Manhattan, which generally pitted immigrants and nativists against each other, or together against the wealthy who controlled the city's police and the state militia.\n\nAlthough the underlying cause of the riot was class conflict, this was expressed in preference over two famous actors performing Shakespeare at the opera house - one, William Macready, was British, and the other, Edwin Forrest, was an American star.\n\nWith the British and American talents serving as proxies for aristocratic and working class sensibilities respectively, the riot began during a performance of Macready's. Shouting "Burn the damn den of the aristocracy", the crowd (mostly working class native Americans and Irish immigrants) threw stones at the building, battled with police, and attempted to set fire to the opera house.`,

In a recent interview, Albright had stated that the hundreds of thousands of Iraqi children predicted to die from the policy was "worth it" to advance U.S. policy in the region.\n\nPalestinian Fadia Rafeedie was initially scheduled to speak before Albright, however Albright's speech was moved first and she immediately left the building following her speech. When it was Rafeedie's time to speak, she put aside her prepared remarks and spoke out against U.S. policy towards Iraq and the devastation it was causing on the population there. She ended her speech by saying this:\n\n"I want to end my speech with a slogan that hangs over my bed in Arabic. It says, 'La tastaw Hishu tareeq el-Haq, min qilit es-sa'ireen fihi' and that translates into, 'Fear not the path of truth for the lack of people walking on it.' I think our future is going to be the future of truth, and we're going to walk on that path, and we're going to fill it with travelers. Thank you very much."`,

The strike pitted the American Railway Union (ARU) against the Pullman Company, the main railroads, and the federal government of the United States under President Grover Cleveland, and was a turning point in U.S. labor law.\n\nThe conflict began in Pullman, Chicago when nearly 4,000 factory employees of the Pullman Company began a wildcat strike in response to recent reductions in wages. After a federal injunction to stop the strike was ignored, 12,000 troops were sent in to forcibly break the strike. All in all, 30 strikers were killed, 57 were wounded, and property damage exceeded $80 million.\n\nThe Pullman Strike was a watershed moment in American labor history - Eugene V. Debs, who led the strike, was arrested and imprisoned, radicalizing his politics and setting him on the path to become a prominent socialist leader and co-founder of the International Worker's of the World (IWW). After the strike was over, President Cleveland declared "Labor Day" a national holiday in an effort to appease organized labor.`,

Tensions were inflamed when a false rumor spread that Charles Evers, older brother of Medgar Evers and a civil rights activist in his own right, had been killed.\n\nThe police responded in force. At least 75 Jackson police units from the city of Jackson and the Mississippi Highway Patrol attempted to control the crowd while the firemen extinguished fires that had been set. After the firefighters had left the scene, the police moved to disperse the crowd that had gathered in front of Alexander Hall, a women's dormitory.\n\nJust after midnight, the police opened fire on the building. The gunfire lasted for 30 seconds and more than 460 shots were fired. Every window on the narrow side of the building facing Lynch Street was shattered and two people were killed, twelve wounded. The killings happened just ten days after the Kent State shootings, in which National Guardsmen killed four protesting students at Kent State University in Ohio.`,

Its efforts to organize both hard rock miners and smelter workers brought it into sharp conflicts - and often pitched battles - with both employers and governmental authorities. It was one of the organizations at the heart of the Colorado Coal Wars.\n\nThe organization's earliest years were radical, adopting an explicitly socialist platform in 1901. "Big Bill" Haywood, who had joined the WFM as a secretary, was a prominent member during this time.\n\nThe WFM played a role in founding the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in 1905, however the split between revolutionaries and reformists led to the WFM withdrawing from the organization several years later and joining the American Federation of Labor (AFL). Because of this, Haywood and prominent labor leader Vincent St. John quit the WFM and channeling their efforts through the IWW instead.`,

It came on the heels of a general strike in Mombasa in 1947, led by the African Workers Federation (AWF).\n\nIn the decade leading up to the strike, Nairobi's population more than doubled to at least 100,000, mostly attributable to wartime migration into the city. This was fueled by serious problems of landlessness in the Kikuyu reserves, which were pushing out increasing numbers of ahoi. The land litigation cases that followed, especially in Kiambu, saw the losers becoming either workers in their former lands, now owned by the growing elite of commercial farmers, or simply leaving for Nairobi.\n\nOn the morning of May 15th, Fred Kubai and Makhan Singh, leaders in the East African Trades Union Congress (EATCU), were arrested by and charged with being officers of an unregistered trade union refusing to dissolve within the three month notification period. Later that day members of the EATCU declared a general strike to begin the following day, but by evening a general strike was already in effect all over Nairobi.\n\nThe strike paralyzed airport travel, public services, and greatly limited commercial business. In a puzzling decision, strike leadership called off the strike after a week's worth of protest, disseminating a return-to-work order for May 25th. In the aftermath of the strike, the power of trade unions was diminished with the government arresting thousands of their members. Despite this setback, the labor movement in Kenya was not broken and continued to gain momentum in the following decade.`,

        description: `The first United States occupation of the Dominican Republic began on this day in 1916 and continued until 1924. It began when "two companies of marines landed from the USS Prairie at Santo Domingo" with the goal of offering protection to the U.S. Legation and the U.S. Consulate, and to occupy the Fort San Geronimo. Within hours, these companies were reinforced with seven additional companies, and two days later the President of the Dominican Republic, Juan Isidro Jimenes, resigned.\n\nThe U.S. took control of the country and began imposing military rule on November 29th, 1916. A guerrilla movement, known as the gavilleros, with leaders such as General Ramón Natera, enjoyed considerable support from the population in the eastern provinces of El Seibo and San Pedro de Macorís. Having knowledge of the local terrain, they fought against the occupation from 1917 to 1921.\n\nDominican control of the island returned in 1924, when the U.S. government agreed to withdraw on condition of holding elections with American oversight and the acceptance of American officers into the Dominican National Guard. Soon after, dictator Rafael Trujillo would begin his first eight reign over the country, waging a brutal and violent suppression of the domestic population and promoting prejudice against Haitians ("Antihaitianismo").`,

Historian Howard Zinn considered this a form of class conflict, as the Regulators described themselves as poor peasants, oppressed by the wealthier classes.\n\nOn this day in 1771, these tensions came to a head in the Battle of Alamance, which was fought between several thousand rebel Regulators and a North Carolina militia. Approximately two dozen men were killed. Notably, most ex-Regulators did not support the American government in the Revolutionary War that began five years later.`,

Ensuing violence lasted periodically throughout the summer before the strike was formally ended on August 22nd, with most of the union demands being met.`,

His life served as an inspiration to both Che Guevara and Fidel Castro\n\nOn February 21th, 1934, Sandino attended a round of talks with Sacasa, the Nicaraguan President. On leaving Sacasa's Presidential Palace, Sandino and five others were stopped in their car at the main gate by local National Guardsmen and were ordered to leave their car. They took Sandino, his brother Socrates, and his two generals to a crossroads section in Larreynaga and executed them.`,

Examples are Le Paria (The Pariah), published in Paris, and Thanh Nien (Youth).\n\nHồ Chí Minh led the Việt Minh independence movement from 1941 onward, establishing the Communist-ruled Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam) in 1945 and defeating the French Union in 1954 at the Battle of Điện Biên Phủ, ending the First Indochina War. He was a key figure in the People's Army of Vietnam and the Việt Cộng during the Vietnam War, which lasted from 1955 to 1975.

I have undertaken vengeance. I want Liberty and Equality to reign in St Domingue. I am working to make that happen. Unite yourselves to us, brothers and fight with us for the same cause."\n\nLouverture was eventually tricked into being arrested by Brunet, a French General, and deported to France, where he died of unknown causes while imprisoned. Shortly thereafter, the colony finally achieved independence under the leadership of Jean-Jacques Dessalines.`,

Foster was the more radical of the two, while Browder endorsed Roosevelt's "New Deal" and was more politically accommodating.\n\nBrowder was the chairman of CPUSA when the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact (an agreement of non-aggression between Soviets and Nazis), and almost overnight the Party changed from being militantly anti-fascist to only engaging in moderate criticism of Germany. CPUSA's membership declined by 15% in the following year.\n\nBrowder was an advocate for a co-operative relationship between the Soviet Union and the United States after World War II, and was sharply criticized by the French Communist Party (later revealed to have been done so on orders from Moscow) in the "Duclos Letter". Due to the domestic Red Scare in the U.S. and his ambitions of co-operative clashing with the Soviet agenda, Browder was expelled from the Communist Party on February 5th, 1946.`,

        description: `The Paris Commune was a radical socialist and revolutionary government that formed in Paris on March 18th, 1871. A hotbed of working-class radicalism, the Paris Commune was a watershed moment in revolutionary left history. A few months after it was formed, the commune was attacked and defeated by the French National Army on this day in 1871, beginning the so-called "Bloody Week".\n\nAfter crushing the rebellion, the French government imprisoned almost 44,000 for their role in the uprising, and estimated deaths from the fighting are around 20,000.\n\nThe government of the Paris Commune developed a set of policies that tended towards a progressive, secular, and highly democratic social democracy, although its existence was too brief to implement all of them. Among these policies were the separation of church and state, abolition of child labor, abolishment of interest on some forms of debt, as well as the right of employees to take over and run an enterprise if it was deserted by its original owner.\n\nThe Paris Commune was analyzed by many communist thinkers, most notably Karl Marx, who called it a "dictatorship of the proletariat." Vladimir Lenin danced in the snow when the newly formed Bolshevik government lasted longer than the Paris Commune. It inspired similar revolutionary attempts around the world, including in Moscow (1905), Petrograd (1917), Shanghai (1927 and 1967), and Seattle (2020).`,

Milk's unsuccessfully ran for office three times, but finally won a seat as a city supervisor in 1977.\n\nMilk was assassinated after only eleven months in office by Dan White, another city supervisor.

As a young adult, Matteotti was activist in the socialist movement and the Italian Socialist Party. He was imprisoned in Sicily for opposing Italy's entry into World War I (and was interned in Sicily during the conflict for this reason).\n\nMatteotti spoke openly against Italian Fascism and Benito Mussolini, and for a time was leader of the opposition to the National Fascist Party (NFP). In 1921, he denounced fascist violence in a pamphlet titled "Inchiesta socialista sulle gesta dei fascisti in Italia" ("Socialist enquiry on the deeds of the fascists in Italy").\n\nOn May 30th, 1924, speaking in the Italian Parliament, he alleged that the Fascists committed fraud in the recently held elections and denounced the violence that they used to gain votes. Eleven days later, he was kidnapped and killed by Fascists.\n\nAfter Matteotti's body was discovered, Mussolini took full responsibility for the murder as head of the Fascist party (although whether he gave a direct order for the murder remains uncertain) and dared his critics to prosecute him for the crime. This challenge went unaccepted. After the Second World War ended, Italian fascists Amerigo Dumini, Giuseppe Viola, and Amleto Poveromo were sentenced to thirty years in prison for their involvement in Matteotti's murder.`,

        description: `On this day in 1919, under the banner of the One Big Union (OBU), approximately 6,500 miners in Alberta, Canada walked off the job during a dispute over wages, the cost of living allowance, and working conditions. The strike took place in the context of federal repression of labor movements; a few years earlier, Canada had banned the similar Industrial Workers of the World (IWW).\n\nAccordingly, the striking workers faced violent repression from both the government and the coal operators. After the walk-out continued more than a month, coal operators received permission from the Northwest Mounted Police to hire "special constables" - in practice unemployed World War I veterans who were paid $10 a day, plied with free liquor, and armed with brass knuckles and crowbars - to break up the strike.\n\nStriking workers were attacked in their homes, and workers who refused to act as scabs were ridded 65-km out of town, beaten, and left there. Strikers responded by forming self-defense militias that deterred constables form attacking them. The labor action was finally broken after the federal government declared the OBU illegal and two strike leaders were beaten, tied to telephone poles, and tarred and feathered in August of that year.\n\nDespite the immediate defeat, the mere threat of militant industrial action allowed coal miners in Alberta to achieve massive gains: the miners' day rate rose from $5.70 to $7.50 between 1919 and 1920 and, even after the strike had collapsed, and the rate remained well above inflation for a few years. These gains were eroded by 1924-25, when salaries were reduced back to the pre-strike levels.`,

Bari was severely injured by the blast, while Cherney suffered minor injuries. The bombing took place in the context of the Redwood Summer protests organized by Earth First!, the culmination of years of labor organizing and environmental activism in California by Bari.\n\nFBI bomb investigators were present on the scene of the bombing almost immediately, leading some to speculate that the FBI either knew of the bombing or was directly involved in it. Bari was arrested for transporting explosives while she was still in critical condition with a fractured pelvis and other major injuries. In 2002, a federal jury found the FBI had violated Bari and Cherney’s civil rights in the case, and the pair was later awarded a $4.4 million payout, although Bari had died five years earlier.\n\nFBI analysis of the explosion dismissed the idea that the bomb was designed by Bari or Cherney. The identity of the bomber is still unknown. As for the protests, subsequent attendance was lower than organizers had hoped, and in November the pro-environment ballot initiative Proposition 130 was defeated by California voters.`,

It was the deadliest industrial disaster in the history of the city, and one of the deadliest in U.S. history.\n\nThe fire caused the deaths of 146 garment workers - 123 women and girls and 23 men - who either burned to death, choked on smoke, or jumped to their deaths from high windows. Most of the victims were recent Italian and Jewish immigrant women and girls aged 14 to 23.\n\nThe death toll was high in part because the doors to the stairwells and exits were locked (a then-common practice to prevent workers from taking unauthorized breaks and to reduce theft). The incident led to legislation requiring improved factory safety standards and helped spur the growth of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU), which fought for better working conditions for sweatshop workers.\n\nThe owners (who survived the fire by fleeing to the roof when it began), were acquitted of manslaughter charges, but found liable for wrongful death. Although they had to pay out $75 per victim killed, their insurance provider paid them out $400 per casualty. Two years later, one of the owners was arrested and fined $20 for again locking his doors during factory hours.`,

It became a permanent committee in 1948.\n\nThe HUAC is perhaps most notorious for causing de facto media censorship among artists suspected of having communist sympathies. Their investigations resulted in a Hollywood blacklist of over 300 actors, directors, and others. Artists whose careers were damaged by the committee include Charlie Chaplin, Orson Welles, Alan Lomax, Paul Robeson, and Yip Harburg.`,

The federal government obtained an injunction against the union, Eugene V. Debs, and other boycott leaders, ordering them to stop interfering with trains that carried mail cars. After the strikers refused, President Grover Cleveland forcibly ended the strike with military force.\n\nDebs and four other ARU leaders were arrested and charged with violating the injunction. After the Supreme Court sided with the government, Debs was sentenced to prison and the ARU dissolved.\n\nIn re Debs contributed to a widely held belief that the Supreme Court was simply a tool of the wealthy and big business - for the next 40 years business interests hostile to labor unions found the courts willing partners in suppressing strikes through injunction. This practice ended in 1932 with the Norris-La Guardia Act.`,

The Act was signed by Andrew Jackson and it was strongly enforced by his and his successor's administrations.\n\nThe enforcement of this law directly led to the infamous "Trail of Tears", which killed over 10,000 indigenous peoples.

Bishop headed the People's Revolutionary Government of Grenada from 1979 to 1983, when he was dismissed from his post and shot in a coup, leading to civil unrest and a U.S. invasion of the country.\n\nAlthough Bishop grew up in Grenada, he left to study in London as a young adult. While there, Bishop acquired a law degree and studied the works of Lenin, Mao Zedong, and Julius Nyerere.\n\nIn 1970, he returned to Grenada and was active politically, representing striking nurses in court and leading the "New Jewel Movement", which ultimately put him in power. In 1979, the New Jewel Movement successfully led a coup against Eric Gairy and made Bishop the Prime Minister of Grenada.\n\nAmong Bishop's core principles were workers' rights, women's rights, and the struggle against racism and apartheid. Women were given equal pay and paid maternity leave, and sex discrimination was made illegal. organizations for education, health care, youth affairs, and literacy were also established. Due to his efforts, illiteracy and unemployment greatly declined.\n\nIn 1983, disputes within the party culminated in Bishop, along with seven members of his cabinet, being captured and executed. After his assassination, the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) and Grenada's governor-general Paul Scoon appealed to the United States for help. Within the month, Ronald Reagan launched an invasion of Grenada.`,

Here is a short excerpt (from Marius Robinson's transcription):\n\n"I want to say a few words about this matter. I am a woman's rights.

I am as strong as any man that is now.\n\nAs for intellect, all I can say is, if a woman have a pint, and a man a quart - why can't she have her little pint full?

A Coroner's Jury declared the killings to be "justifiable homicide". The press often called it a labor or red riot.

He is considered among the most influential figures of anarchism and a major founder of the social anarchist tradition. Bakunin's prestige as an activist also made him one of the most famous ideologues in Europe, gaining substantial influence among radicals throughout Russia and Europe.\n\nBakunin is remembered as a major figure in the history of anarchism, an opponent of Marxism, especially of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and for his predictions that Marxist regimes would be one-party dictatorships over the proletariat, not by the proletariat. His book, God and the State, has been widely translated and remains in print. Bakunin continues to influence anarchists such as Noam Chomsky.\n\nIt is worth noting that Bakunin espoused anti-Semitic views in some of his works, writing "...and where there is centralization of the state, there must necessarily be a central bank, and where such a bank exists, the parasitic Jewish nation, speculating with the labor of the people, will be found."\n\nHis biographer Mark Leier wrote that, "Bakunin had a significant influence on later thinkers, ranging from Peter Kropotkin and Errico Malatesta to the Wobblies and Spanish anarchists in the Civil War to Herbert Marcuse, E.P. Thompson, Neil Postman, and A.S. Neill, down to the anarchists gathered these days under the banner of 'anti-globalization.'"`,

In this essay, he coined the well-known phrase "war is the health of the state," by which Bourne lamented governments' success at arrogating authority and resources during conflicts.\n\nBourne was also disfigured from a difficult birth and suffered from tuberculosis of the spine at a young age, resulting in stunted growth and a hunched back.

        description: `The Conspiracy of 1741, also known as the Negro Plot of 1741 or the Slave Insurrection of 1741, was a purported plot by slaves and poor whites in the British colony of New York in 1741 to revolt and level New York City with a series of fires. Historians disagree as to whether such a plot existed and, if there was one, its scale.\n\nThe city of New York was hysterical with paranoia over poor whites and slaves collaborating to burn the city down. During the court cases, the prosecution kept changing the grounds of accusation and repeatedly ignored the alibis proffered by slaveowners for their slaves' non-involvement. At its height, over half of the city's male slaves over the age of 16 were implicated in the plot and jailed.\n\nOn this day in 1741, the first two victims, two slaves named Kofi and Quaco, were hanged. After the hysteria ended, eighteen slaves were hanged, thirteen burned alive, four whites were executed, and dozens of people had been deported out of the city.`,

        description: `The Tulsa Race Massacre began on this day in 1921, when mobs of white residents attacked black residents and businesses of the Greenwood District in Tulsa, Oklahoma. It has been called "the single worst incident of racial violence in American history", with estimates ranging from 75-300 people killed, 800 wounded, and 10,000 black families made homeless from the destruction of property.\n\nThe massacre began over Memorial Day weekend after 19-year-old Dick Rowland, a black shoeshiner, was accused of assaulting Sarah Page, the 17-year-old white elevator operator of the nearby Drexel Building. An armed group of black men showed up to the jail to counter the lynch mob had been formed, and shots rang out as a white member of the mob tried to disarm one of the black men. The initial violence left ten people dead, and a mob of enraged white people stormed black neighborhoods, indiscriminately killing people and destroying property.\n\nFor 75 years (until 1996), the massacre was largely omitted from local, state, and national histories. It was not recognized in the Tulsa Tribune feature of "Fifteen Years Ago Today" or "Twenty-five Years Ago Today", and a 2017 report detailing the history of the Tulsa Fire Department from 1897 until the date of publication makes no mention of the 1921 fire.`,

This event was the largest demonstration in support of children in U.S. history, and led directly to the founding of the advocacy organization Stand for Children (SFC). Rosa Parks spoke at the rally, stating that "If I can sit down for justice, you can stand up for children."\n\nFollowing their work at the rally, Jonah Edelman and Eliza Leighton founded SFC as a vehicle to advocate for the nation's children. The organization has, however, faced criticism for its ultra-wealthy donors and board members, as well as its opposition to teacher's unions. Susan Barrett, a former volunteer co-leader of a SFC team in Portland, Oregon, resigned from her position with SCF due to concerns along these lines.`,

The son of a Baptist minister, West focuses on the role of race, gender, and class in American society and the means by which people act and react to their "radical conditionedness". A radical democrat and advocate for social democracy, West draws intellectual contributions from multiple traditions, including Christianity, the black church, Marxism, and transcendentalism. Among his most influential books are Race Matters (1994) and Democracy Matters (2004).\n\nWest has described himself as a "non-Marxist socialist" (partly because he does not view Marxism and Christianity as reconcilable) and serves as honorary chair of the Democratic Socialists of America, which he has described as "the first multiracial, socialist organization close enough to my politics that I could join". He also described himself as a "radical democrat, suspicious of all forms of authority" in the Matrix-themed documentary The Burly Man Chronicles.\n\nWest was arrested on October 13th, 2014, while protesting against the shooting of Michael Brown and participating in Ferguson October, and again on August 10th, 2015, while demonstrating outside a courthouse in St. Louis on the one-year anniversary of Brown's death.`,

The internet in Sudan was blacked out for days following the massacre.\n\nThe sit-in emerged out of the Sudanese revolution, beginning with mass anti-government protests in December 2018.
        On April 11th, the military removed Omar al-Bashir from power in a coup d'état and created a Transitional Military Council (TMC). Protesters supported by the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA) and democratic opposition groups engaged in street demonstrations, demanding the TMC to turn over power to a civilian-led transitional government.\n\nIn the days following the massacre, anti-TMC protests became even more intense, and a general strike involving 60-100% of workers broke out. Roads were blocked, and almost all formal and informal businesses were closed, including, banks, public transport and Khartoum International Airport.`,

As a result of the ruling, the players were compelled to work under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement that dated back to 2005.`,

        description: `On this day in 1943, the Zoot Suit Riots began when thousands of white American servicemen in California began indiscriminately attacking people (mostly Latinos) wearing Zoot Suits, which were seen as unpatriotic. The suits were ostensibly seen as unpatriotic due to wartime rations, although they were also racialized, with L.A. Councilman Norris Nelson stating "the zoot suit has become a badge of hoodlumism".\n\nThe riots began on the night of June 3rd when ~12 sailors and a group of young Mexicans in zoot suits began fighting. The LAPD responded to the incident "seeking to clean up Main Street from what they viewed as the loathsome influence of pachuco gangs", according to historian Luis Alvarez. The police arrested the sailors and not the Mexicans.\n\nThe next day, 200 sailors headed for East Los Angeles, a Mexican-American part of town, and attacked and stripped everyone they came across who were wearing zoot suits. Local press heralded the violence as cleaning up the town, and soon thousands of sailors joined the riot. Journalist Carey McWilliams described what happened like this:\n\n"Marching through the streets of downtown Los Angeles, a mob of several thousand soldiers, sailors, and civilians, proceeded to beat up every zoot suiter they could find. Pushing its way into the important motion picture theaters, the mob ordered the management to turn on the house lights and then ran up and down the aisles dragging Mexicans out of their seats. Streetcars were halted while Mexicans, and some Filipinos and Negroes, were jerked from their seats, pushed into the streets and beaten with a sadistic frenzy."\n\nThe L.A. City Council approved a resolution criminalizing zoot suits, although the ordinance was not signed into law. The Navy and Marine Corps Staff prohibited sailors from traveling to L.A. in an effort to curb the violence, however they officialy maintained that the men were acting in self-defense.`,

        description: `The 1835 Philadelphia general strike took place in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was the first general strike in North America and involved some 20,000 workers who struck for a ten-hour workday and increased wages. The strike ended in complete victory for the workers and paved the way for a ten-hour day in the American and European labor movements more broadly.\n\nInfluenced by labor agitation in Boston, in 1835 unskilled Irish workers on the Schuylkill River coal wharves went on strike for a ten-hour day. The coal heavers were soon joined by workers from many other trades, including leather dressers, printers, carpenters, bricklayers, masons, house painters, bakers, and city employees.\n\nOn June 6, a mass meeting of workers, lawyers, doctors, and a few businessmen, was held in the State House courtyard. The meeting unanimously adopted a set of resolutions giving full support to the workers' demand for wage increases and a shorter workday, as well as increased wages for women workers and a boycott of any coal merchant who worked his men more than ten hours.\n\nThe strike quickly came to a close after city public works employees joined the action. The Philadelphia city government announced that the "hours of labor of the working men employed under the authority of the city corporation would be from 'six to six' during the summers season, allowing one hour for breakfast, and one for dinner." On June 22nd, three weeks after the coal heavers initially struck, the ten-hour system and an increase in wages for piece-workers was adopted in the city.`,

        description: `In the early 19th century U.S., the legality of trade unions was in question. Some courts called them "conspiracies to restrain trade", and were therefore illegal. In 1836, twenty-five members of the Union Society of Journeymen Tailors were found guilty of "conspiracy to injure trade, riot, assault, and battery".\n\nOn this day the same year, 27,000 people gathered in City Hall Park to protest the court decision. A radical pamphlet circulated, titled "The Rich Against the Poor", that denounced the judge who issued the decision as a "tool of aristocracy".\n\nThe protesters established a "Committee of Correspondence" that comprised of people working in trades, and that organization went on to found the working class Equal Rights party.`,

As a young adult, Matteotti was activist in the socialist movement and the Italian Socialist Party. He was imprisoned in Sicily for opposing Italy's entry into World War I (and was interned in Sicily during the conflict for this reason).\n\nMatteotti was spoke openly against Italian Fascism and Benito Mussolini, and for a time was leader of the opposition to the National Fascist Party (NFP). In 1921, he denounced fascist violence in a pamphlet titled "Inchiesta socialista sulle gesta dei fascisti in Italia" ("Socialist enquiry on the deeds of the fascists in Italy").\n\nOn May 30th, 1924, speaking in the Italian Parliament, he alleged that the Fascists committed fraud in the recently held elections and denounced the violence that they used to gain votes. On this day that year, Matteotti was kidnapped and killed by fascists.\n\nAfter Matteotti's body was discovered, Mussolini took full responsibility for the murder as head of the Fascist party (although whether he gave a direct order for the murder remains uncertain) and dared his critics to prosecute him for the crime. This challenge went unaccepted. After the Second World War ended, Italian fascists Amerigo Dumini, Giuseppe Viola, and Amleto Poveromo were sentenced to thirty years in prison for their involvement in Matteotti's murder.`,

Quảng Đức's act increased international pressure on Diệm and led him to announce reforms with the intention of mollifying the Buddhists. The promised reforms were not implemented, however, leading to inflamed tensions and Diệm's eventually assassination on November 2nd, 1963.\n\nQuảng Đức body was re-cremated during the funeral, but his heart remained intact and did not burn. It was considered to be holy and placed in a glass chalice at Xá Lợi Pagoda. The intact heart relic is regarded as a symbol of compassion.`,

His murder and the resulting trials inspired civil rights protests; his life and these events inspired numerous works of art, music, and film.

These conditions defined the terms of Cuban-U.S. relations to be an unequal one of U.S. dominance over Cuba, both politically and economically.\n\nFollowing acceptance of the amendment, the United States ratified a tariff that gave Cuban sugar preference in the U.S. market and protection to select U.S. products in the Cuban market. Over $200 million was spent by American companies on Cuban sugar between 1903 and 1913, and this investment into sugar led to land being concentrated into the hands of the largest sugar mills, with estimates that 20% of all Cuban land was owned by these mills.`,

The parade was over three miles long and had signs in dozens of languages.\n\nThe event was very peaceful, with no mention of violence or arrests made reported by the New York Times. Despite the show of force, U.S. nuclear weapons programs were not limited until after the end of the Cold War, several years later.`,

The papers were released by Daniel Ellsberg, who had worked on the study.\n\nThey were first brought to the attention of the public on the front page of The New York Times on this day in 1971. A 1996 article in The New York Times said that the Pentagon Papers had demonstrated, among other things, that the Johnson Administration "systematically lied, not only to the public but also to Congress."\n\nOn January 3rd, 1973, Ellsberg was charged under the Espionage Act of 1917 along with other charges of theft and conspiracy, carrying a total maximum sentence of 115 years. Due to governmental misconduct and illegal evidence-gathering he was dismissed of all charges against Ellsberg on May 11th, 1973.`,

A major figure of the Cuban Revolution, his stylized visage has become a ubiquitous countercultural symbol of rebellion and global insignia in popular culture.\n\nFollowing the Cuban Revolution, Guevara performed a number of key roles in the new government. These included reviewing the appeals and firing squads for those convicted as war criminals during the revolutionary tribunals, instituting agrarian land reform as minister of industries, helping spearhead a successful nationwide literacy campaign, serving as both national bank president and instructional director for Cuba's armed forces, and traversing the globe as a diplomat on behalf of Cuban socialism.\n\nHis life experiences and studying of Marxism-Leninism led him to posit that the Third World's underdevelopment and dependence was an intrinsic result of imperialism, neocolonialism and monopoly capitalism, with the only remedy being proletarian internationalism and world revolution. Guevara left Cuba in 1965 to foment revolution abroad, first unsuccessfully in Congo-Kinshasa and later in Bolivia, where he was captured by CIA-assisted Bolivian forces and summarily executed.`,

Justice for Janitors includes more than 225,000 janitors in at least 29 cities in the United States and at least four cities in Canada. Members fight for better wages, better conditions, improved health-care, and full-time opportunities.\n\nOn this day in 1990, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) attacked immigrant janitors who were striking for the right to organize in Century City, Los Angeles. Two women miscarried, dozens were hospitalized, and 60 strikers and supporters were jailed. Police initially claimed to be defending themselves, however TV footage was aired that undermined this claim.\n\nDespite the violence, voted unanimously to return to the scene of the violence and continue their protest. Janitors their eventually won their union, doubling their pay and benefits. This victory gave a lot of momentum to the JfJ movement and led to successful protests and organizing of janitors around the country.`,

An excerpt reads:\n\n"We need to wake up and realize that our real enemies are not in some distant land...The enemy is a system that wages war when it's profitable. The enemy is CEOs who lay us off our jobs when it's profitable. It's the insurance companies who deny us health care when it's profitable. It's the banks who take away our homes when it's profitable. Our enemies are not five thousand miles away. They are right here at home."`,

Berger, Eugene V. Debs, Emma Goldman, Alexander Berkman, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, Daniel Ellsberg, Chelsea Manning, Julian Assange, and Edward Snowden.\n\nA 2015 study by the PEN American Center found that almost all of the non-government representatives they interviewed, including activists, lawyers, journalists and whistleblowers, "thought the Espionage Act had been used inappropriately in leak cases that have a public interest component." PEN wrote, "experts described it as 'too blunt an instrument,' 'aggressive, broad and suppressive,' a 'tool of intimidation,' 'chilling of free speech,' and a 'poor vehicle for prosecuting leakers and whistleblowers.'"`,

While not Mayan himself, Marcos has often served as the group's spokesman.\n\nMarcos led the EZLN during the 1994 revolt and the subsequent peace negotiations, during a counter-offensive by the Mexican Army in 1995, and throughout the decades that followed. In 2001, he led a group of Zapatista leaders into Mexico City to meet with President Vicente Fox, attracting widespread public and media attention.`,

The local hospital would not treat black people, and Harry died on the way to the nearest one that would, 30 miles away in Sanford, Florida. Harriette died from her wounds nine days later, on January 3rd, 1952, at the same hospital.

A state investigation and forensic work in 2005 identified four Ku Klux Klan members who likely committed the bombing, however they had all been dead for many years.`,

Months prior, the UMWA had called a national miners' strike. The owner of the local Illinois mine, W.J. Lester, negotiated with the union to allow his mine to remain open and for miners to go back to work, as long as no coal was shipped out.\n\nBy June, over 60,000 tons of coal had been dug up and the Lester decided to break his agreement with the miners and sell the coal anyway. Early in the morning of June 21nd, a truck carrying Lester's guards and strikebreakers was ambushed near Carbondale, Illinois on its way to the mine. The union miners marched into Herrin, looted the hardware store of its firearms and ammunition, and laid seige to the mine.\n\nThe strikebreakers working in the mine surrendered to the union workers firing upon them, and were captured as prisoners. Despite promises of safety, they were massacred by the union miners. Twenty-three miners were killed, most of whom were members of the strikebreaking group. W.J. Lester, the owner of the mine, made a handsome profit from selling his mine after the massacre occurred.`,

After the Great Panic of 1873, mine owners imposed a new contract on the workforce which lowered pay rates by between 10 and 20%. This led to the Long Strike of 1875 which lasted seven months and saw the governor order in troops to the region.\n\nWhen the strike failed, some Irish-American miners turned to tactics that had been employed in Ireland in the late 17th and 18th centuries - using oath bound societies, anonymous threats and in some cases violent retribution on those deemed hostile to their community. The Molly Maguires society emerged from this historical backdrop.\n\nIn 1876-77, twenty suspected Molly Maguires were convicted of murder and other crimes on the basis of very dubious evidence (mostly testimony from an undercover Pinkerton Agent). It was on this day in 1877 that six of the convicted men were hanged in the prison at Pottsville, and four at Mauch Chunk, Carbon County. American historian of labor Philip Foner concluded that they were likely framed due to their labor activism.`,

Two days later, he flew into a Moscow Airport, where Russian authorities noted that his U.S. passport had been cancelled, and he was restricted to the airport terminal for over one month.

Until January 1st, 1867, the bill specified, only free Blacks and loyal Whites would be allowed access to these lands. Homesteaders were required to occupy and improve the land for five years before acquiring full ownership.\n\nMany Southern bureaucrats often obstructed or violated the law, notably not informing blacks of their right to land (thus delaying and allowing Confederates to be eligible, from 1867 onwards). It was also difficult for freed slaves to take advantage of the opportunity just from lack of materials, often lacking seed, animals, and farm tools.\n\nDespite this, free Blacks entered about 6,500 claims to homesteads, and about 1,000 of these eventually resulted in property certificates. The law was repealed a decade later as part of a growing coalition of cooperation between Northern and Southern capitalists (this cooperation became more explicit with the Compromise of 1877, which resulted in federal troops withdrawing from Southern states).`,

A similar demonstration also took place in a large tractor factory in Ursus, near Warsaw.\n\nAlthough the authorities arrested and prosecuted many hundreds of protesters, within 24 hours, the price raises were reversed.

The battle, which resulted in the defeat of U.S. forces, was the most significant action of the Great Sioux War.\n\nIt began on this day in 1876 when Colonel Custer, who was killed in the fighting, led an attack against an encampment of combined tribes. His strategy was to seize as many "non-combatants" as possible (i.e., women, the disabled, and children), and force the men to surrender to protect their families. Custer drastically underestimated the amount of Native Americans present, however, and no member of his attacking battalion survived their charge on the Native Americans.\n\nUnfortunately, the Native American victory did not have momentum in their battle against the seizure of their lands. Days later, Crazy Horse (a leader in the Sioux resistance) surrendered to the government and died in custody. As a result of the battle, the U.S. government threatened to withhold all food aid to reservations if the Sioux did not cease hostilities and cede South Dakota land. Threatened with starvation, they complied in 1877.`,

His work is characterized by lucid prose, biting social criticism, opposition to totalitarianism, and outspoken support of democratic socialism.\n\nAs a writer, Orwell produced literary criticism and poetry, fiction and polemical journalism; and is best known for his allegory for the Soviet Union "Animal Farm" (1945) and the dystopian novel "Nineteen Eighty-Four" (1949). Orwell should also be noted for his first hand-account of the Spanish Civil War, "Homage to Catalonia" (1938).\n\nIn "Homage to Catalonia", Orwell writes about fighting for the Republican faction, describing in detail the ways in which the anarchist movement re-structured their economy and military to be more egalitarian. He was eventually shot in the throat, declared unfit for service, and returned to England to recover.\n\nOrwell's experiences in Catalonia made him a vehement anti-Stalinist, but he still remained a democratic socialist throughout the rest of his life.`,

Inspired by President John F. Kennedy's inaugural address, Meredith decided to exercise his constitutional rights and apply to the University of Mississippi, hoping to put pressure on the Kennedy administration to enforce civil rights for African Americans.\n\nIn 1966, Meredith planned a solo 220-mile March Against Fear from Memphis, Tennessee, to Jackson, Mississippi, to protest racial discrimination in voter registration. The second day, he was shot by a white gunman. Leaders of major organizations vowed to complete the march in his name after he was taken to the hospital.\n\nWhile Meredith was recovering, more people from across the country became involved as marchers. Meredith rejoined the march after recovering, and when the estimated 15,000 marchers reached Jackson, Mississippi, it became the largest civil rights march in Mississippi history.`,

Specific examples of his policies include giving educational grants to indigenous children, literacy programs in impoverished areas, and establishing a minimum wage for workers of all ages.\n\nOn September 11th, 1973, the military moved to oust Allende in a coup d'état assisted by the Henry Kissinger and the CIA. As troops surrounded La Moneda Palace, he gave his last speech vowing not to resign. Later that day, Allende died of suicide with a gun, according to an investigation conducted by a Chilean court with the assistance of international experts in 2011.`,

The U.S., also concerned by the presence of communists in the Guatemalan government, began planning a coup that would be led by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)\n\nThe CIA armed, funded, and trained a force of 480 men led by Carlos Castillo Armas. Castillo Armas' force invaded Guatemala on June 18th and was backed by a heavy campaign of psychological warfare, which included a radio station which broadcast anti-government propaganda and a version of military events favorable to the rebellion, claiming to be genuine news.\n\nAlthough the invasion force's military actions fared poorly, the psychological warfare and fear of a U.S. invasion intimidated the Guatemalan army, which eventually refused to fight. Árbenz briefly and unsuccessfully attempted to arm civilians to resist the invasion, before resigning on this day in 1954 He was succeeded in power by Carlos Castillo Armas, the same man who led the invading force.`,

She and anarchist writer Alexander Berkman, her lover and lifelong friend, planned to assassinate industrialist and financier Henry Clay Frick as an act of "propaganda of the deed". Frick survived the attempt on his life, and Berkman was sentenced to 22 years in prison. Goldman was imprisoned several times in the years that followed for "inciting to riot" and illegally distributing information about birth control.\n\nAfter their release from prison, Goldman and Berkman were again arrested and deported to Russia. Initially supportive of that country's October Revolution that brought the Bolsheviks to power, Goldman changed her opinion in the wake of the Kronstadt rebellion; she denounced the Soviet Union for its violent repression of independent voices. She left the Soviet Union and in 1923 published a book about her experiences, My Disillusionment in Russia.\n\nDuring her life, Goldman was lionized as a freethinking "rebel woman" by admirers, and denounced by detractors as an advocate of politically motivated murder and violent revolution. Her writing and lectures spanned a wide variety of issues, including prisons, atheism, freedom of speech, militarism, capitalism, marriage, free love, and homosexuality.`,

She supported striking workers, including those murdered the 1914 Colorado Ludlow Massacre, and called owner John D. Rockefeller a "monster of capitalism." She defined herself as a "militant suffragist," campaigning for women's right to vote because she believed this was linked to the struggle for socialism.\n\nContemporary critics lambasted Keller for her socialism. In a 1924 letter to a U.S. Senator, she wrote "So long as I confine my activities to social service and the blind, they compliment me extravagantly, calling me ‘arch priestess of the sightless,' ‘wonder woman,' and a ‘modern miracle.' But when it comes to a discussion of poverty, and I maintain that it is the result of wrong economics - that the industrial system under which we live is at the root of much of the physical deafness and blindness in the world - that is a different matter!"\n\nBy the time Keller died in 1968 at 87, the FBI had kept her under surveillance for most of her adult life.`,

It arose from the failure of the political authorities to take action on the various economic grievances of workers in a large machinery plant against local management decisions. In the course of the march to the town square, many workers from other factories joined in as a sign of solidarity.\n\nThe purpose of the demonstration was not to revolt against the authorities, however, but rather to bring home to the public the poor working conditions in the factory and to appeal to officialdom for some improvement. Commenting subsequently on the character of the demonstration, a perceptive eyewitness observed that it had been "reminiscent of the January 1905 Petersburg march [on the Czar's palace] rather than the activities of workers in the second half of the 20th century."\n\nAfter being shot at by police, the peaceful protest turned into a riot, with various shops and official buildings being destroyed. Approximately seventy-five people were reported to have been killed, several hundreds were wounded, and uncounted numbers of others were subject to beatings and physical abuse.\n\nThe Poznan Revolt shattered the image of the party's and government's seemingly indisputable authority, and it became the catalyst for a large movement toward social and political change throughout Poland.`,

Badawi is an advocate for women's rights in Saudi Arabia, having participated in the 2011-2012 women driving campaign and suing the Saudi Arabian government for the right to vote in 2011, making her the first person to file a lawsuit for women's suffrage in the country.\n\nBadawi has been arrested multiple times for her activism and non-compliance with laws that restrict rights for women. After Badawi missed several trial dates relating to charges of disobedience under the Saudi Arabian male guardianship system (brought by her father), she served six months in jail.\n\nIn 2018, Badawi and several other feminist activists were arrested by the Saudi authorities, sparking a major diplomatic dispute between Canada and Saudi Arabia when the former demanded Badawi's immediate release. According to Amnesty International, as of May 2020 Badawi was still imprisoned.`,

It set criminal penalties for advocating the overthrow of the U.S. government by force or violence and required all non-citizen adult residents to register with the federal government.\n\nThe number registered non-citizens began in August of 1940 and passed 4.7 million by January of 1941. After the U.S. declared war in 1941, federal authorities used data gathered from alien registrations to identify citizens of enemy nations and take 2,971 them into custody by the end of the year.\n\nApproximately 215 people were indicted under the legislation, including alleged communists, anarchists, and fascists. One of the most notable cases was a ten-month trial of eleven communist leaders in 1949, ten of whom were sentenced to five years in prison. Prosecutions under the Smith Act continued until a series of U.S. Supreme Court decisions in 1957 reversed a number of convictions under the Act, as unconstitutional. The law has also been amended several times, but is still in effect.`,

        description: `The Homestead Strike was an industrial lockout and strike which began on this day in 1892, culminating in a battle between strikers and private security agents on July 6th. Unlike earlier strikes in American history (such as the Great Railroad Strike of 1877), the Homestead Strike was organized and purposeful, a harbinger of the type of worker organization to come in the modern era of labor relations.\n\nIn order to break the union at the Carnegie Steel Factory, Henry Clay Frick locked workers out of the factory on June 28th. On July 1st, thousands of workers began striking. Frick hired the Pinkerton Agency to guard strikebreaking workers he was bringing on a barge (the factory was on a river), but the workers were patrolling a ten-mile stretch of the river to prevent them from making it to the factory.\n\nOn July 6th, the Pinkertons attempted to land under cover of darkness around four in the morning, however there were thousands of striking workers and sympathizers waiting for them on the riverbank. When Pinkertons attempted to land, gunfire erupted, killing four and injuring twenty-three on both sides. The Pinkertons eventually surrendered to the crowd, however many were beaten unconscious after leaving the boat.\n\nThe strike was forcibly ended by state militia and the miners were defeated. The union there, the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers, collapsed and the union returned to work in August. For his role in breaking the union, anarchists Alexander Berkman and Emma Goldman unsuccessfully attempted to assassinate Henry Clay Frick.`,

Racial tensions began to increase in February, 1917 when 470 African American workers were hired to replace white workers who had gone on strike against the Aluminum Ore Company. The use of non-white strikebreaking workers often fractured class solidarity along racial lines.\n\nAt a city council meeting, angry white workers lodged formal complaints against black migrations to the Mayor of East St. Louis. After the meeting had ended, news of an attempted robbery of a white man by an armed black man began to circulate through the city. As a result of this news, white mobs formed and rampaged through downtown, beating all African Americans who were found. The mobs also stopped trolleys and streetcars, pulling black passengers out and beating them on the streets and sidewalks.\n\nIn spite of this terrorization of the black community, no meaningful protection or reform was offered by the city government. On this day in 1917, the racial violence resumed at a fever pitch, with white mobs gunning down men, women, and children and burning down the homes of black families with them trapped inside. Over one hundred black people were killed.`,

Her experiences made her more focused on advocacy for those who, in her view, mainstream society and the assimilationist sectors of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) communities were leaving behind.\n\nRivera died during the dawn hours of February 19th, 2002, at St. Vincent's Hospital, of complications from liver cancer.

Everything he wrote, said and did was the product of someone who knew his vocation to be that of a liberator, and he represents for the Congo what Castro does for Cuba, Nasser for Egypt, Nkrumah for Ghana, Mao Tse-tung for China, and Lenin for Russia."`,

        description: `On this day in 1839, angry tenant farmers on New York's oldest estate assembled in the Albany County village of Berne to adopt a declaration of independence from their landlord. Their previous landlord, Stephen van Rensselaer III, who owned all 726,000 acre of the effectively feudal estate of Rensselaerwyck had passed away a few months prior.\n\nThe farmers issued a declaration of independence, which said "We will take up the ball of the Revolution where our fathers stopped it and roll it to the final consummation of freedom and independence of the masses.". Thus began the longest rent strike in United States history, the Anti-Rent War.\n\nThe rebellion lasted for six years, during which time the farmers fought off attempts to collect rent by force. In 1844, the movement formed a prominent political party, known as the "Antirenter" party. In 1846, provisions for tenants' rights - abolishing feudal tenures and outlawing leases lasting longer than twelve years - were added to the New York Constitution.`,

Under the law, immigrant workers would pay for their passage with up to a year's wages.\n\nThis law provided corporations with cheap labor that could (and would) be used to break strikes. In the face of vociferous protests by labor organizations, Congress repealed this law in 1868.`,

The speech is perhaps the most widely known of all of Frederick Douglass' writings save his autobiographies. Here is a brief excerpt.\n\n"What, to the American slave, is your 4th of July? I answer: a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim.\n\nTo him, your celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, an unholy license; your national greatness, swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless; your denunciations of tyrants, brass fronted impudence; your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery; your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religious parade, and solemnity, are, to him, mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy - a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages.\n\nThere is not a nation on the earth guilty of practices, more shocking and bloody, than are the people of these United States, at this very hour."`,

At the time, approximately one out of six children under the age of sixteen were employed, according to the 1900 census.\n\nThe march began when Mother Jones tried to get newspapers to report on the conditions of child workers and they informed her that they would not run the stories about child labor because of the mill owners holding stock in the papers. Jones replied "Well, I've got stock in these little children and I'll arrange a little publicity."\n\nThe march successfully won that publicity, bringing national attention to the plight of working children. On July 29th, Jones and fellow marchers arrived at Roosevelt's Sagamore Hill summer home, where he refused to meet with them. Although the strike was an initial failure, it galvanized support for anti-child labor laws to be passed on the national level, which finally occurred with the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.`,

Between this and crackdowns, approximately 200 members were arrested.\n\nThis suppression took place in the context of a broader political struggle against the state, spearheaded by the union. A year earlier, the Norwegian Workers Association had delivered a petition, signed by more than 13,000 people, to King King Oscar II of Sweden, demanding equality before the law, military conscription to be extended to property owners, and universal suffrage. When the government dismissed the petition, the union began agitating for revolution.\n\nThe Workers Association was one of the first major labor movements in Norway. It was founded by Marcus Thrane in 1848, who was inspired by the ongoing revolution in France. The association grew rapidly through 1849 and 1850. At its peak, the group boasted 273 chapters and 25,000-30,000 members. Following the crackdown and Thrane's imprisonment, the movement collapsed.`,

The strike was declared by United Mine Workers (UMW) District 20, which had more than 20,000 members, against U.S. Steel, which had just purchased the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Rail Company (TCI) and instituted sharp pay cuts. More than 4,000 miners stayed off the job, but soon the protest grew to more than 10,000 people.\n\nMine owners responded by increasing their use of unpaid convicts leased from the state, deputizing hundreds of armed men to confront the workers, and urging Governor Braxton Bragg Comer to declare martial law and dispatch state troops into the coalfields, a request he eventually granted. Evicted from company housing, thousands of workers were forced to live in tent cities, which were later attacked by state troops.\n\nThe strike was also notable for the union's ability to unite miners across the racial divide, a development that was highly unusual for the United States in this period. A parade of striking black and white miners through the streets of Jasper angered members of Birmingham's business community, who denounced the UMW's interracial workforce as an insult to southern traditions and called for armed state intervention against the racially mixed strikers. In mid-August, black UMW member William Millin was snatched from his jail cell and lynched by two mine deputies.\n\nThe strike was effectively put down after state troops destroyed the miners' tent cities on August 26th, and was officially called off by the union four days later. One year afterward, the mines' production had returned to normal.`,

He was charged with violating the Espionage Act, accused of obstructing the draft in connection with a speech given at a rally on May 17th, 1917. Shortly after his release from prison, he participated in the 1919 Cleveland May Day march, attended by over 20,000 people. The police attacked the protesters, killing two and injuring hundreds.`,

        description: `The Phoenix Program was a program designed and coordinated by the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) during the Vietnam War sought to destroy the Viet Cong (VC) via infiltration, torture, capture, counter-terrorism, interrogation, and assassination. This included attacking their "political infrastructure", i.e., non-combatant supporters. The Phoenix Program "neutralized" 81,740 people suspected of VC membership, of whom 26,369 were killed and the rest surrendered or were captured.\n\nThe program was incredibly controversial, with one former U.S. military intelligence officer describing it as a "sterile depersonalized murder program". There were many reports of torture and murder of prisoners as well. Because the program targeted ostensible civilians, many innocent people were killed. Some rival Vietnamese would even report their enemies as Viet Cong in order to get U.S. troops to kill them.\n\nAfter Phoenix Program abuses began receiving negative publicity, it was officially shut down in 1971, although the program continued under the name Plan F-6 with the government of South Vietnam in direct control.`,

She also was appointed as a national adviser to president Franklin D. Roosevelt, whom she worked with to create the Federal Council on Negro Affairs, also known as the "Black Cabinet."\n\nBorn in South Carolina to parents who had been slaves, Bethune started working in fields with her family at age five. She took an early interest in becoming educated, and later became a big exponent of education within the black community. She started a school for African-American girls that later, after merging with a boys' school, became known as the "Bethune-Cookman School" and served as its president on multiple occasions.\n\nFor her lifetime of activism, Bethune was deemed "First Lady of Negro America" by Ebony magazine in 1949, and was also known by the black press as the "female Booker T. Washington". Journalist Louis E. Martin stated that "She gave out faith and hope as if they were pills and she some sort of doctor."`,

The miners had declared a strike to demand that a "living wage" of $3.50 per day be paid to every man working underground, both skilled and unskilled. This solidarity between unskilled and skilled labor (a principle known as industrial unionism) was unusual for the era.\n\nOn the morning of July 11th, gunfire erupted between striking workers and scabs working in the mines. The "battle" was won by the striking miners after they dynamited one of the mills, destroying the building and crushing one non-union worker inside. The rest of the strikebreakers promptly surrendered and were taken prisoner.\n\nLater that evening, striking workers placed explosives beneath an ore mill and gave its manager the choice between firing the strikebreakers or having his mill destroyed. He chose the former. Before the day was over, six people were killed and dozens were wounded.\n\nFollowing this violence, martial law was declared in Coeur d'Alene and the town was under military rule by the Idaho National Guard for four months. Hundreds of miners were illegally detained, without hearings or formam charges. The event was disastrous for the local miners' union. In an effort to reorganize the workforce, the Western Federation of Miners (WFM) was founded the following year.`,

The International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) engaged in multiple episodes of rebellion. On this day that year, leaders of the ILWU (along with many other dock workers) were arrested for occupying the Port of Longview's huge new, ultra-automated grain terminal a $200 million dollar facility built by EGT (a large shipping conglomerate) that was scheduled to soon begin testing operations with non-union labor.\n\nSheriff's deputies and city cops from Longview and neighboring Kelso arrested the protesters, who did not resist. "We have worked this dock for 70 years", said Dan Coffman, President of ILWU Local 21, "and to have a big rich company come in and say, 'We don't want you' is a problem. We're all together. We're going to jail as a union."\n\nThree days later, six hundred dock workers and supporters seized the railroad tracks that serve the Port. At 1:30 am, they stopped a train, 107 cars hauling corn, originating in Split Rock, Minnesota, headed for the Longview elevators. On September 7th, 2011, a massive picket line of some 700 longshoremen and their supporters blocked another train from entering EGT's terminal. When cops started pepper spraying, the picketers pushed back.\n\nThe next day, the wrath of the rank and file rained down on EGT. Longshoremen from the major Northwest ports, Seattle, Tacoma and Portland, seeing images of the ILWU president being manhandled by cops, stopped work and began destroying EGT property. According to news reports, the cyclone fence was torn down, grain was dumped from the train cars, and the terminal was briefly occupied by angry longshore workers. Millions of dollars were lost in shipping, warning employers how far ILWU members were willing to go to protect their jobs.`,

It opposed what its members believed were policies of accommodation and conciliation promoted by African-American leaders such as Booker T. Washington. During this three day meeting, Monroe and Du Bois co-authored a "Declaration of Principles", which defined the group's philosophy and demands: politically, socially and economically (full text is linked under "Learn More" below).`,

In these areas, cantons were formed, whose federation would constitute the base of the Spanish Federal Republic. Although the federalists defied the authority of the Cortes, historians do not consider the movement separatist in character.\n\nThe Cantonal Rebellion was put down by force form the First Spanish Republic, which portrayed itself as maintaining the rule of law. When the last canton, Cartagena, surrendered, thousands of people were deported to the Philippines, Cuba, and the Marianas Islands on charges of being a federalist.`,

Despite this, King paid homage to Nixon, calling him "a symbol of the hopes and aspirations of the long oppressed people of the State of Alabama."`,

Although the event began as anger against the draft, it quickly devolved into a race riot.\n\nThe exact death toll during the New York draft riots is unknown, but according to historian James M. McPherson, 119 or 120 people were killed; most of those killed were Irish, who were the majority of the rioters. Eleven blacks were killed in the violence, all due to being lynched. The event lasted three days and was suppressed by the U.S. Army on Lincoln's orders. The race riot remains the largest civil and most racially-charged urban disturbance in American history.`,

The attack was in response to attempts by the British government to charge taxes on ships that used the town as a port, among other grievances.\n\nIn response to international outrage regarding the incident, president Franklin Pierce issued a statement acknowledging that, while it would have been more satisfactory if the Cyane's mission could have been consummated without the use of force, "the arrogant contumacy of the offenders rendered it impossible to avoid the alternative either to break up their establishment or to leave them impressed with the idea that they might persevere with impunity in a career of insolence and plunder."`,

In the months running up to the uprising, the people were facing a dire economic crisis, food shortage, and increased militarization of Paris on orders of King Louis XVI. The Bastille was an armory and prison that was widely perceived as a symbol of royal authority in the city.\n\nAround mid-morning on July 14th, a crowd of approximately one thousand people surrounded the Bastille, calling for the surrender of the prison, the removal of the cannon there, and the release of the arms and gunpowder.\n\nAfter negotiations stalled, the crowd surged into the courtyard of the Bastille and were fired upon by troops in the garrison. In the carnage that followed, 98 protesters and 1 defender of the Bastille were killed. Governor Marquis de Launay capitulated to the crowd and opened up the Bastille doors.\n\nAs news of the successful seizure of the Bastille spread throughout the country, people established parallel structures of power for civic government and militias for civic protection, burned deeds of property, and in some cases attacked wealthy landlords. The Storming of the Bastille is considered a flashpoint that helped ignite French Revolution and is annually commemorated as "Bastille Day" in France today.`,

In June, 1822 he was accused and convicted of being the leader of this planned slave revolt and executed on July 2nd.\n\nIn the aftermath of Vesey's and others' convictions, authorities blamed "black religion" for contributing to the uprising, noting that Vesey had co-founded a local African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church. The reverend of the church was driven out of the state, Charleston officials ordered the large congregation to be dispersed and the building razed, and no black church officially met in Charleston until after the Civil War.`,

HRUM also demanded "total self determination of all health services through a community-worker board to operate Lincoln Hospital."\n\nAs a result of their takeover, over a hundred news articles reported the controversies over the hospital's conditions, eventually leading to the passage of anti-lead poisoning legislation. The Young Lords later launched the People's Program at Lincoln Hospital, which was a methadone detoxification program run entirely by volunteers.`,

This strike finally ended some 69 days later, after it was put down by unofficial militias, the National Guard, and federal troops.\n\nBecause of economic problems and pressure on wages by the railroads, workers in numerous other cities, including New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Illinois, and Missouri, also went out on strike.\n\nAn estimated 100 people were killed in the unrest across the country, and more than one hundred million dollars worth of property was damaged. In Martinsburg, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and other cities, workers burned down and destroyed both physical facilities and the rolling stock of the railroads - engines and railroad cars.\n\nDue to this unrest and other labor efforts, the B&O became the first major employer to offer a pension plan in 1884.`,

He frequently performed with the slogan "This machine kills fascists" displayed on his guitar.\n\nThroughout his life, Guthrie was associated with United States communist groups, writing a column for the communist newspaper People's World from May 1939 to January 1940 and stating once that "the best thing that I did in 1936 was to sign up with the Communist Party.`,

In 2004, Aristide was ousted in another coup after right-wing ex-army paramilitaries invaded the country from across the Dominican border, and fled to South Africa. He finally returned to Haiti in 2011, after seven years in exile.`,

The pro-Western president, Camille Chamoun asked for U.S. assistance after the July 14th Revolution in Iraq, which resulted in the death of the Iraqi king and prime minister in a coup d'etat.\n\nThe intervention, known as "Operation Blue Bat", consisted of more than 14,000 footsoldiers, were supported by a fleet of 70 ships and 40,000 sailors. American and Lebanese government forces successfully occupied the Port of Beirut and Beirut International Airport.\n\nThe military occupation lasted until October 25th, until President Chamoun completed his term as president of Lebanon. According to historian Maurice Labelle, "this was the first overt U.S. military intervention in the region", and it cast the U.S. as an imperialist power in the Middle East, willing and able to militarily occupy countries there to manage its interests.`,

Munitions detonated while being loaded onto a cargo vessel bound for the Pacific Theater of Operations, killing 320 sailors and civilians and injuring 390 others. Most of the dead, injured, and those assigned to clean up the wreckage were enlisted African American sailors.\n\nAccording to historian Erika Doss, "just a few weeks after the disaster, and with no discussion of why the horrific explosion of July 17th had occurred or how to prevent such a disaster from happening again, the black sailors were ordered back to work loading ordnance at the Mare Island Navy Yard in Vallejo. Over 250 of the men refused...". This refusal came to be known as the "Port Chicago Mutiny".\n\nFifty men‍, known as the "Port Chicago 50", ‌were convicted of mutiny and sentenced to 15 years of prison and hard labor, as well as a dishonorable discharge. A young Thurgood Marshall undertook a formidable legal campaign, appealing their convictions, and, due to his efforts and popular pressure, the Navy eventually released 47 of the 50 mutineers.\n\nThe incident highlighted racial inequality within the Navy and was one of several incidents that led to it ending its practice of segregation in 1946.`,

Ideologically an African nationalist and socialist, he served as the president of the African National Congress (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997.\n\nAlthough initially committed to non-violent protest, in association with the SACP he co-founded the militant Umkhonto we Sizwe in 1961 and led a sabotage campaign against the government. He was arrested and imprisoned in 1962, and subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment for conspiring to overthrow the state following the Rivonia Trial. Mandela served 27 years in prison.\n\nAmid growing domestic and international pressure, and with fears of a racial civil war, President F. W. de Klerk released him in 1990. Mandela and de Klerk led efforts to negotiate an end to apartheid, which resulted in the 1994 multiracial general election in which Mandela led the ANC to victory and became president.`,

Eight soldiers were killed in clashes, and another 15 were wounded.\n\nThe strike began on July 19th when one crew, led by Conductor Ryan, sent word that they would not take out their train. Striking workers refused to cede control of the trains to the company, and by midnight up to 1,400 strikers had gathered in the Pennsylvania Railroad rail yards, stopping the movement of some 1,500 cars.\n\nBy the morning of the 21st, it had become clear that many of the Pittsburgh police and local militia had sided with the strikers and were refusing to take action against them. The Pennsylvania National Guard were sent in to forcibly quell the rebellion, and the protest turned into a riot after troops shot into a crowd of people for ten minutes, killing women and children. Rioters began looting, setting fire to the train cars, and exchanged fire with the national guard soldiers.`,

The strike began on May 16th in the Market District (now called the Warehouse District) and led to widespread unionizing throughout the city of Minneapolis.\n\nIts worst single day of violence was this day in 1934, known as "Bloody Friday". It occurred when police shot at strikers who were blocking off the delivery of company merchandise, killing two and injuring sixty-seven. Four days later, 100,000 people lined the streets of the funeral procession route for one of the workers and demanded the resignation of the Minneapolis Police Chief.\n\nIn response to this, Governor Olson first ordered that the union headquarters be raided, and a couple days later ordered a raid on Citizen Alliance headquarters. Violence lasted periodically throughout the summer before the strike was formally ended on August 22nd, with most of the union demands being met.`,

Hutchinson was known for being a powerful speaker, and insisted on the ability of women to read the bible for themselves, among other "unauthorized" interpretations of the gospel.\n\nOn November 7th, 1637, Hutchinson was brought to trial, where she was called a heretic and an instrument of the devil, and was exiled from the Puritan community for her beliefs. Thirty-five families, supporters of Hutchinson, followed her to settle Long Island.\n\nHutchinson is a key figure in the history of religious freedom in England's American colonies and the history of women in ministry, challenging the authority of the ministers. She has been called "the most famous - or infamous - English woman in colonial American history".`,

On this day in 1936, the "Central Committee of Anti-Fascist Militias of Catalonia" was founded, becoming the main governing body of the region.\n\nThe growing influence of the Marxist-Leninist Spanish Communist Party government and their desire to nationalize revolutionary committees and militias brought it into conflict with the anarchist CNT, resulting in the eventual replacement of the CNT by the PCE as the dominant political force in Catalonia until the arrival of the fascists. Notably, this conflict left writer George Orwell bitter about the role that Marxist-Leninist groups played in suppressing anarchist movements, and he was a committed anti-Stalinist for the rest of his life.\n\nThis anarchist period of Catalonia was deeply rooted in the ideas of anarcho-syndicalism and anarcho-communism. Catalonia was the first and only territory in Spanish history that has been rooted in these ideas, and its existence has been influential in socialist history.`,

The St. Louis strike was largely organized by the Knights of Labor and the Marxist-leaning Workingmen's Party, the main radical political party of the era.\n\nOn this day in 1877, in East St. Louis, Illinois, train workers held a secret meeting, resolved to call for an increase in wages, and strike if their demands were not met. The demand was made and rejected that same night, and so, effective at midnight, the strike began in East St. Louis. Within hours, strikers virtually controlled the city.\n\nAlthough the strike was mostly bloodless, the protesters seized the city's Union Depot, stopped freight and some passenger trains from passing through the city, and destroyed much property, including flour mills, sugar refineries, and dismantling over forty factories. The strike ended when the National Guard and U.S. Marshals began to successfully break up demonstrations by force five days later.`,

Composed mainly of confrontations between black residents and the Detroit Police Department, it began on this day in 1967.\n\nIn the early hours July 23rd, Detroit Police Department (DPD) officers raided an unlicensed weekend drinking club in the office of the United Community League for Civic Action. They expected a few revelers inside, but instead found a party of 82 people celebrating the return of two local GIs from the Vietnam War. The police decided to arrest everyone present.\n\nAfter the DPD left, a crowd of onlookers began looting an adjacent clothing store. Shortly thereafter, full-scale looting began throughout the neighborhood. This looting escalated into a city-wide uprising that involved shootouts between rioters and police officers.\n\nThe violence escalated throughout the next day, resulting in some 483 fires and 1,800 arrests. Thousands of guns were stolen from stores. Firefighters attempting to put out fires were shot at, police abuse of power was rampant. Thousands of federal troops occupied the city, but the rioting could not be quelled until July 28th.\n\n43 people were killed, most of whom were black. Among the dead was a four year old girl named Tanya Blanding, who was shot and killed by Sgt. Mortimer J. LeBlanc after he fired indiscriminately into her mother's apartment. LeBlanc was exonerated of any wrongdoing. The scale of the riot was the worst in the United States since the 1863 New York City draft riots during the American Civil War and was not surpassed until the 1992 Los Angeles riots 25 years later.`,

By July 26th, it grew to include perhaps thousands of workers from a variety of industries.\n\nViolence erupted on August 1st after angry strikers attacked the town's mayor and then clashed with local militia. The militia shot into the crowd, leaving four dead and many more wounded.\n\nThe next day, state national guard arrived to Scranton and imposed martial law. Comparatively minor acts of violence continued throughout the strike.`,

The revolution began on this day in 1953, and continued sporadically until the rebels finally ousted Batista on the 31st of December, 1958, replacing his government with a revolutionary socialist state.\n\nThe Cuban Revolution had powerful domestic and international repercussions. In particular, it made Cuba's relationship with the United States significantly more antagonistic. In the immediate aftermath of the revolution, Castro's government began a program of nationalization, centralization of the press and political consolidation that transformed Cuba's economy and civil society. The revolution also ushered in an era of Cuban intervention in foreign military conflicts, perhaps most notably siding with anti-apartheid fighters against the government in South Africa (1962-74).\n\nToday is celebrated in Cuba as the Day of the Revolution (Dia de la Revolución). Castro's 26th of July Movement later reformed along communist lines, becoming the Communist Party in October of 1965.`,

Many of these reservists were the only breadwinners for their families, while the wealthy were able to hire substitutes.\n\nThese actions, coupled with anarchist, anti-militarist, and anti-colonial philosophies shared by many in the city, resulted in the calling of a general strike against Maura's attempt at conscription. By the next day, workers had occupied much of central Barcelona, halting troop trains and overturning trams. Just a few days later, there was street fighting, with a general eruption of riots, strikes, and the burnings of convents.\n\nThe Spanish government declared a "state of war" and used the national army to put down the rebellion by force. Over one hundred civilians were killed and more than 1,700 individuals were indicted in military courts for "armed rebellion"`,

Large crowds, up to 25,000 people, began to gather and demand various labor reforms. On this day in 1877, violent clashes between protesters and police reached a fever pitch in the "Battle of the Viaduct", where police and members of the crowd exchanged gunfire.\n\nBy that evening, the police had successfully dispersed crowds throughout the city. 14 to 30 rioters were dead or dying, and 35 to 100 civilians and 9 to 13 policemen were wounded.`,

        description: `The Bonus Army was a group of 43,000 demonstrators, made up of 17,000 U.S. World War I veterans, together with their families and affiliated groups, who gathered in Washington, D.C. in mid-1932 to demand early cash redemption of their service certificates. They were known as the "Bonus Army" or "Bonus Marchers".\n\nMost of the Bonus Army camped in a "Hooverville" on the Anacostia Flats, a swampy, muddy area across the Anacostia River from the federal core of Washington (now Section C of Anacostia Park). Approximately 10,000 veterans, women and children lived in the shelters that they built from materials dragged out of a junk pile nearby, which included old lumber, packing boxes, and scrap tin covered with roofs of thatched straw.\n\nOn this day in 1932, President Hoover ordered the Secretary of War to disperse the protesters. After the veterans returned after being pushed out the first time, police fired on the veterans, killing two of them. Federal troops were called in and, armed with bayonets and tear gas, forcefully evicted the Bonus Army.\n\nIn the mayhem that followed, 55 veterans were injured, 135 were arrested, and one three month old baby died. The incident was politically disastrous for President Hoover, who lost the election that year to Franklin Delano Roosevelt. In 1933, another Bonus Army marched on Washington D.C., but FDR, perhaps learning from his predecessor's mistakes, created a camp for the soldiers and fed them.`,

Raised in rigidly segregated Anniston, Alabama, Braden grew up in a white, middle-class family that accepted southern racism, later experiencing a "a conversion of almost religious intensity" and becoming an anti-racist activist.\n\nIn 1954, Andrew and Charlotte Wade, an African American couple who knew Anne and her husband Carl Braden, approached them with a proposal to buy a house on their behalf in a suburb in which they couldn't purchase a home due to Jim Crow laws. The Bradens agreed to the deal, and, on the Wades' first night in the new suburbs, angry residents burned a cross in their yard and shot out the windows to the house. Six weeks later, the Wades' new house was dynamited one evening while they were out.\n\nAfter a sensationalized trial, her husband Carl Braden - the perceived ringleader - was convicted of sedition and sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment, although the Supreme Court ruled the laws on which he was convicted unconstitutional and he was freed after eight months. In later life, Anne Braden joined Jesse Jackson's "Rainbow/PUSH Coalition" and continued her social activism. In 2005, a year before her death, she joined Louisville antiwar demonstrations in a wheelchair.`,

The July intervention took place following the murder of dictator President Vilbrun Guillaume Sam by insurgents angered by his political murders of elite opposition.\n\nPresident Wilson ordered the invasion to "protect American and foreign" interests. He also wanted to rewrite the Haitian constitution, which banned foreign ownership of land, and replace it with one that guaranteed American financial control. To avoid public criticism, Wilson claimed the occupation was a mission to "re-establish peace and order...and has nothing to do with any diplomatic negotiations of the past or the future".\n\nWhen the Haitian legislature refused to ratify a new constitution that allowed foreigners to own land in Haiti, the U.S. backed President Dartiguenave dissolved the legislature and the constitution became law. U.S. occupiers also re-instituted a system known as civil conscription (impressed labor), in which Haitian civilians were captured and forced to work on public projects, such as building roads, and established the National Guards.\n\nThe U.S. continued to militarily occupy Haiti until August 15th, 1934.`,

Factory workers poured out into the streets and joined the police in beating Jewish mourners.\n\nAlthough historians have cited this ugly incident as a vivid example of Irish Catholic antisemitism, noting that both the workers and policemen were "predominantly Irish," recent historical research shows that the factory workers were mostly Germans, not Irish, and that the police were following standard practice in quelling a riot. It is a notable example of anti-Semitic violence regardless.`,

The subsequent strike lasted nearly three years, and resulted in replacement of most of the striking workers and decertification of the unions.\n\nAlthough there had been no fatalities during the strike, various acts and threats of violence increased the political pressure on Democratic governor Babbitt to intervene. Despite having stated "Phelps Dodge has the worst record in labor relations of any company that has ever operated in Arizona", Babbitt ordered 750 National Guard and state police officers to protect business operations.\n\nEight days later, 10 strikers were arrested in Ajo and charged with rioting, further breaking the strike. In September 1984, the new workforce (hired strikebreakers) began voting in elections deciding whether or not to decertify the unions. The result was the largest mass decertification in US history: 35 locals of 13 different unions representing Phelps Dodge workers were decertified in Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. The strike officially ended on February 19th, 1986.`,

While the riot was typical of numerous racial conflicts during Reconstruction, this incident had special significance. It galvanized national opposition to the moderate Reconstruction policies of President Andrew Johnson and ushered in the much more sweeping Congressional Reconstruction in 1867.\n\nThe riot took place outside the Mechanics Institute in New Orleans as black and white delegates attended the Louisiana Constitutional Convention. As a delegation of 130 black New Orleans residents marched behind the U.S. flag toward the Mechanics Institute, Mayor John T. Monroe (who had supported the Confederacy) organized and led a mob of ex-Confederates, white supremacists, and members of the New Orleans Police Force to the Institute to block their way.\n\nOnce the marchers reached the Institute, the police and white mob members attacked them, beating some of the marchers while others rushed inside the building for safety. As the firing continued, some delegates attempted to flee or surrender. Some of those who surrendered, mostly blacks, were killed on the spot. Those who ran were chased, and the killing spread over several blocks around the Institute. Altogether, 238 people were killed and 46 were wounded, including 200 black Union veterans.`,

The war was triggered by a German policy designed to force the indigenous population to grow cotton for export, and it lasted from 1905 to 1907.\n\nIn the days leading up to the rebellion, a spirit medium named Kinjikitile Ngwale developed a belief that the people of German East Africa had been called upon to eliminate the Germans. On July 31st, in what was the first act of the uprising, Matumbi tribesmen marched on Samanga and destroyed the cotton crop there, as well as a trading post.\n\nIn the aftermath, Kinjikitile was arrested and hanged for treason, and people throughout German East Africa began to revolt. The resulting war lasted two years, with the Germans successfully putting the rebellion down by force.\n\nAs a means to weaken the rebellion, German soldiers deliberately orchestrated a famine by destroying available food sources, devastating the region and killing hundreds of thousands of people. Such was the scale of this destruction that, in 1953, journalist John Gunther noted "even today the Southern Province of Tanganyika, the 'Cinderella Province,' has not fully recovered from the German terror half a century ago. The economy of the region has never been successfully rebuilt.".`,

The strike was in support of the movement advocating a ten-hour work day and for a redress of grievances such as newly imposed lunch hour regulations.\n\nThere were two primary reasons that the strike failed in its objectives. First, the Secretary of the Navy refused to change the shipyard working hours. Second, the striking workers (who were white) violently lashed out at the capitol's free black population in an incident known as the "Snow Riot", and this killed public support for the strike itself.\n\nFive years later, in 1840, all public workers finally received a ten hour day by order of President Martn Van Buren.`,

The two parties merged in 1905 in the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO).\n\nToday, a key aspect of his legacy is his anti-militarism. Jaurès was an early opponent of the draft and desperately tried to prevent war between France and Germany before World War I, going so far as to try and organize a general strike in both countries to force their leaders to negotiate diplomatically.\n\nIn 1914, Jaurès returned to Paris from a diplomatic meeting in Brussels to advocate against the coming war. He was assassinated by a French nationalist at the outbreak of World War I, and remains one of the main historical figures of the French Left.`,

The strike was triggered by the decision of the Philadelphia Transportation Company (PTC), made under prolonged pressure from the federal government in view of significant wartime labor shortages, to allow black employees to hold non-menial jobs that were previously reserved for white workers only.\n\nThe strike was widely unpopular and paralyzed the public transport system in Philadelphia for several days, bringing the city to a standstill and crippling its war production.\n\nInvoking the authority of the Smith-Connally Act, President Roosevelt sent 8,000 United States Army troops to the city to seize and operate the transit system, and threatened to draft any PRTEU member who did not return to the job within 48 hours. This act broke the strike, and black workers were allowed to work in non-menial roles on the transit system.`,

In 1903, Jones organized children who were working in mills and mines to participate in a "Children's Crusade", a march from Kensington, Philadelphia to Oyster Bay, New York, the hometown of President Theodore Roosevelt with banners demanding "We want to go to school and not the mines!"\n\nMother Jones was present during the Paint Creek-Cabin Creek strike of 1912 in West Virginia, speaking and organizing despite a shooting war between United Mine Workers members and the private army of the mine owners. Jones was arrested on February 13th, 1913, brought before a military court, and accused of conspiring to commit murder among other charges. She was sentenced to twenty years in the state penitentiary, but released after eighty-five days.`,

No one was apprehended for his murder, although IWW members alleged members of the local police were involved, noting that Butte's chief of detectives, Ed Morrissey, took a three week leave of absence after Little's death.\n\nAn estimated 10,000 workers lined the route of Frank Little's funeral procession, which was followed by 3,500 more people. His funeral is still the largest ever in Butte history.`,

During the tour, he lectured to students, white liberals, and others about his racial ideology, an ideological position between the "muscular approach" of Malcolm X and the nonviolent program of Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\nBaldwin was also a socialist who expressed hope that it would take root in the United States.`,

The incident began when three North Vietnamese torpedo boats were surveilling the American destroyer USS Maddox as it performed intelligence operations in North Vietnamese waters. The Maddox initiated the incident by opening fire, shooting off three "warning" shots; the North Vietnamese boats replied with torpedoes and machine gun fire. The exchange caused ten North Vietnamese casualties and damaged one U.S. helicopter; there were no American casualties.\n\nIn response, the U.S. Congress passed a "Gulf of Tonkin Resolution", which granted U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson the authority to assist any Southeast Asian country whose government was considered to be jeopardized by "communist aggression". The resolution served as Johnson's legal justification for deploying U.S. conventional forces and the commencement of open warfare against North Vietnam.\n\nOn television, President Johnson made misleading statements about the incident and portrayed U.S. military escalation as an act of defense. Since then, the Pentagon Papers, the memoirs of Robert McNamara, and NSA publications from 2005, have proven that the U.S. government lied about the nature of the incident to justify a war against Vietnam.`,

Reagan demanded those remaining on strike return to work within 48 hours or officially forfeit their positions.\n\nOnly 1,300 of the nearly 13,000 controllers returned to work. PATCO also disobeyed a federal court injunction ordering an end to the strike and to return to work. On August 5th, following the PATCO workers' refusal to return to work, Reagan fired the 11,345 striking air traffic controllers who had ignored the order and banned them from federal service for life. PATCO was also decertified by the Federal Labor Relations Authority a few months later.`,

Five years later, when surrounded by Spanish troops, he shot himself under the chin with a .45 caliber pistol to not give them the satisfaction of capturing him. Although the bullet went out of his forehead and knocked him unconscious, he survived; the wound left a great scar and gave him headaches for the rest of his life.\n\nGarcía played a key role in the ultimately successful War of 1895 and protested the subsequent lack of Cuban autonomy in the conclusion of the war (no Cuban was allowed to sign the terms of surrender and the Spanish leaders in Cuba were allowed to keep their posts in Santiago). He died of pneumonia at age 59 on December 11th, 1898, while on a diplomatic mission in Washington, D.C. Today, his portrait is on the 50 Cuban peso banknote.`,

        description: `James Hal Cone, born on this day in 1938, was an American theologian, best known for his advocacy of black theology and black liberation theology. His 1969 book Black Theology and Black Power provided a new way to comprehensively define the distinctiveness of theology in the black church.\n\nDistilled, his message was that Black Power, defined as black people asserting the humanity that white supremacy denied, was the gospel in America. Jesus came to liberate the oppressed, advocating the same thing as Black Power. He argued that white American churches preached a gospel based on white supremacy, antithetical to the gospel of Jesus.`,

He was very sympathetic with libertarian socialist thinkers, such as Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Benjamin Tucker, but a committed anti-Marxist.\n\nHall is perhaps most remembered today for his widely circulated plea for the working class to oppose the Spanish-American War, titled "A Peace Appeal to Labor" (1898). He also helped create a still-existing Georgist commune known as "Free Acres" in New Jersey by deeding 68 acres of land to the project in 1910. Hall was also arrested with Ida Rauh for handing out pamphlets on birth control in 1916.`,

She joined the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) in 1936 and late in life, in 1961, became its chairwoman.\n\nFlynn was also a founding member of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), but was expelled in 1940 during purge of all communists from ACLU leadership. This decision was reversed twelve years after her death, in 1976.\n\nIn 1948, she was arrested, along with eleven other prominent members of the Communist Party, for violating the Smith Act. She served two years in prison, and continued her political activism after her release. Flynn died during a visit to the Soviet Union, where she was accorded a state funeral with processions in the Red Square attended by over 25,000 people.`,

Zapata was responsible for defeating and ousting various invading armies from Morelos on multiple occasions.`,

Jiménez was born to jíbaro parents in Caguas, Puerto Rico, but spent his formative years in Chicago.\n\nIn the summer of 1968, he was picked up for a possession of heroin charge and given a 60-day sentence at Cook County Jail. While in jail, he read "The Seven Story Mountain" by Thomas Merton, and became politically radicalized, reading the works of MLK Jr., Malcolm X, and the Black Panther Party (BPP).\n\nAfter his release, Jiménez transformed the Young Lords from a street gang into a human rights organization, entering into the "Rainbow Coalition" with Fred Hampton, head of the BPP's Chicago chapter. After Hampton's assassination and the Coalition's dissolution, Jiménez continued his activism and would go on to be arrested dozens of times for leading protests and engaging in civil disobedience.`,

Overcrowding was so bad that more than 2,000 people were being held in space meant for less than a 1,000.\n\nPrisoners took command of the entire ninth floor, and five officers were held hostage for eight hours, until state officials agreed to hear prisoner grievances and take no punitive action against the rioters. Despite that promise, Mayor John Lindsay had the primary troublemakers shipped upstate to the state's Attica Correctional Facility which likely contributed to the Attica Prison riot about a year later.\n\nThe uprising was ended by force on Mayor John Lindsay's order, with police and guards retaking the prison with tear gas and hand to hand fighting. Hundreds of prisoners were injured. Within a month of the uprising's end, the New York City Legal Aid Society filed a class action suit on behalf of pre-trial detainees held in the Tombs.\n\nThe city decided to close the Tombs on December 20th, 1974, after years of litigation and after federal judge Morris E. Lasker agreed that the prison's conditions were so bad as to be unconstitutional. `,

The Defensa Interior had been infiltrated by government spies, however, and after arriving in Madrid Christie was promptly arrested by undercover police.\n\nChriste was freed after serving three years in prison. He went on to found the Cienfuegos Press publishing house and in 2008 the online Anarchist Film Channel, which hosts films and documentaries with anarchist and libertarian socialist themes.`,

Most of the 40,000 Native Hawaiians, including Liliʻuokalani and the royal family, shuttered themselves in their homes, protesting against what they considered an illegal transaction.\n\nThe revolution and subsequent annexation of Hawaii was the beginning of a long period of expansionism from the United States. Just three years later, the U.S. refused to withdraw troops from Cuba until their government ratified the Platt Amendment, which let Cuba only have "independence" under de facto American hegemony.`,

        description: `On this day in 1946, nearly 100,000 black South African mine workers of the Witwatersrand went on strike in support of a demand for higher wages - 10 shillings a day. They continued the strike for a week in the face of the most savage police terror, in which officially 1,248 workers were wounded and a very large number - officially only 9 - were killed.\n\nLawless police and army violence smashed the strike. The resources of the racist state were mobilized, almost on a war footing, against the unarmed workmen. A profound result of the strike was the effect it had on the thinking of the national liberation movement - almost immediately it shifted significantly from a policy of concession to more dynamic and militant forms of struggle.`,

He was also leader of Argentina's largest Marxist guerrilla group, the Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo (People's Revolutionary Army, ERP).\n\nSantucho and a significant part of the PRT leadership were killed on July 19th, 1976, as part of a covert ambush carried out by a paramilitary task force connected to the Argentine Armed Forces. His and his wife's remains were never found.\n\nThis attack was part of the "Dirty War" perpetrated by the US-backed Argentinian dictatorship against left-wing dissidents (including students, guerrilla fighters, labor activists, and journalists). It is estimated that around 30,000 people were murdered due to this persecution.`,

After Galleani was deported from the United States to Italy in June 1919, his colleagues are alleged to have carried out the Wall Street bombing of 1920, which resulted in the deaths of 38 people.`,

Castro came into power in early 1959 after years of revolutionary struggle against the U.S.-backed regime of Fulgencio Batista (1901 - 1973). Ideologically a Marxist-Leninist and Cuban nationalist, he also served as the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba from 1961 until 2011.\n\nWith Castro as Prime Minister, the Cuban government nationalized and expanded healthcare and education, redistributed land to the peasant class, and implemented rent controls. Within a year, Castro and his government had effectively redistributed 15 percent of the nation's wealth.\n\nThe longest-serving non-royal head of state in the 20th and 21st centuries, Castro has polarized opinion throughout the world. While some critics view him as a dictator whose administration oversaw human-rights abuses, the exodus of many Cubans, and the impoverishment of the country's economy, his supporters view him as a champion of socialism and anti-imperialism whose revolutionary regime advanced economic and social justice while securing Cuba's independence from U.S. hegemony.`,

Instead, they would show up en masse to work and a handful would be selected - the rest would be sent home without payment. In this way, their employers could only pay for exactly the labor needed for the day.\n\nOn August 14th, led by socialist union organizer Ben Tillet, the men in the West India Dock struck immediately started persuading other dockers to join them. The support they needed came when the Amalgamated Stevedores Union (whose workers were essential the operation of the dock), under Tom McCarthy, joined the strike.\n\nThe labor action became so large (one estimatation was 130,000 workers), that it could possibly be considered a general strike. A newspaper reported "Dockmen, lightermen, bargemen, cement workers, carmen, ironworkers and even factory girls are coming out."\n\nThe London Dock Strike resulted in a victory for the 100,000 strikers and established strong trade unions amongst London dockers, one of which became the nationally important "Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Labourers' Union". The strike is widely considered a milestone in the development of the British labor movement, symbolizing the growth of industrial unionism, including casual, unskilled and poorly paid workers, in contrast to craft unionism.`,

Little had also escaped.\n\nShe turned herself in a week later and was charged with first degree murder, which, if convicted, would result in the death penalty.

The shootings have been compared to the infamous Sharpeville massacre in 1960 (also another instance of police firing on crowds in South Africa). The incident took place on the 25-year anniversary of a nationwide strike by over 300,000 South African Miners.\n\nThe Marikana massacre began as a wildcat strike at a mine owned by Lonmin in the Marikana area, close to Rustenburg, South Africa. Although ten people (mostly workers) had been killed before August 16th, it was on that day that an elite force from the South African Police Service fired into a crowd of strikers with assault rifles, killing 34 injuring 76 were injured.\n\nAfter surveying the aftermath of the violence, photojournalist Greg Marinovich concluded that "[it is clear] that heavily armed police hunted down and killed the miners in cold blood." A year after it occurred, author Benjamin Fogel wrote "Perhaps the most important lesson of Marikana is that the state can gun down dozens of black workers with little or no backlash from 'civil society', the judicial system or from within the institutions that supposedly form the bedrock of democracy."`,

Initially demanding the same war bonus that had been given to men, their demands morphed into equal pay, more than forty years before the Equal Pay Act. The slogan of the strike was "Same Work - Same Pay".\n\nThe strike spread throughout the city - an estimated 18,000 out of a total 27,000 women working in the public transport industry participated. The strike was settled on the 25th of August. The women won the 5 shilling war bonus, but not equal pay.`,

He was the founder and first President-General of the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA-ACL, commonly known as UNIA), through which he declared himself Provisional President of Africa. Ideologically a black nationalist and Pan-Africanist, his ideas came to be known as Garveyism.\n\nGarvey was a controversial figure. Some in the African diasporic community regarded him as a pretentious demagogue and were highly critical of his collaboration with white supremacists (the collaboration was predicated on a mutual belief in racial separatism), his violent rhetoric, and his prejudice against mixed-race people and Jews.\n\nHe nevertheless received praise for encouraging a sense of pride and self-worth among Africans and the African diaspora amid widespread poverty, discrimination, and colonialism.\n\nGarvey is seen as a national hero in Jamaica, and his ideas exerted a considerable influence on such movements as Rastafari, the Nation of Islam, and the Black Power Movement.`,

Turner (1800 - 1831) was born and raised in Southampton County, Virginia, an area where black people outnumbered whites. He learned how to read and write at a young age and was deeply religious, eventually becoming an influential preacher in the area.\n\nIn early 1831, on the basis of religious visions, Nat Turner began preparing a slave insurrection. The rebellion began on this day in 1831, and rebels traveled from house to house, freeing slaves and killing many of the white people that they encountered.\n\nAt least 55 white people were killed, and the slaves killed men, women, and children. The group spared a few homes "because Turner believed the poor white inhabitants 'thought no better of themselves than they did of negroes'". The rebellion was put down by a combined force of local militia and three companies of artillery. The state executed 56 black people, and militias killed at least 100 more, some of whom were not involved in the rebellion.\n\nTurner went on the run, eluding capture for six weeks. On October 30th, 1831, a white farmer discovered him hidden among the local Nottoway people in a depression in the earth, created by a large, fallen tree that was covered with fence rails. After being tried and convicted for "conspiring to rebel and making insurrection", he was asked if he regretted what he had done. Turner responded "Was Christ not crucified?"\n\nHe was hanged on November 11th, 1831. After his death, state legislatures passed new laws prohibiting education of slaves and free black people, restricting rights of assembly and other civil liberties for free black people, and requiring white ministers to be present at all worship services.`,

Unfortunately, a member of their group had become an FBI informant, and the FBI was monitoring the break-in, arresting everybody involved.\n\nThe 28 chose to be tried together, refusing an offered plea bargain for a single misdemeanor if the rest of the charges were dropped. Howard Zinn testified at the trial and recommended civil disobedience and jury nullification.

Within the next ten days, slaves had taken control of the entire Northern Province in an unprecedented slave revolt. The slaves sought revenge on their masters through "pillage, rape, torture, mutilation, and death". Over 200,000 black people died from the initial uprising until independence.\n\nToussaint Louverture was a notable military leader of the revolution, but died shortly before independence was won.

Management refused to speak with the workers' representatives and James Rider, manager of The Pressed Steel Car Company, responded to their strike by hiring Pearl Bergoff, a notorious owner of a strike-breaking paramilitary force.\n\nThe walkout drew national attention when, on this day in 1909, a bloody battle took place between strikers, private security agents, and the Pennsylvania State Police. The violence began after strikers boarded a trolley to search for scabs and they were confronted by an armed deputy, who opened fire. In the fighting that followed, between 12 and 26 people were killed.\n\nThe strike was settled on September 8th when Pressed Steel Car agreed to a wage increase, the posting of wage rates, and ended abuses in company housing practices. The Pressed Steel Car Strike was a precursor to the Great Steel Strike of 1919.`,

Known as an outspoken advocate for gay rights, Johnson was one of the prominent figures in the Stonewall uprising of 1969. A founding member of the Gay Liberation Front, Johnson co-founded the socialist activist group Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (S.T.A.R.), alongside her close friend Sylvia Rivera.\n\nJohnson was one of the first drag queens to go to the Stonewall Inn, after they began allowing women and drag queens inside; it was previously a bar for only gay men. On the early morning hours of June 28th, 1969, the Stonewall uprising occurred. While the first two nights of rioting were the most intense, the clashes with police would result in a series of spontaneous demonstrations and marches through the gay neighborhoods of Greenwich Village for roughly a week afterwards.\n\nShortly after a pride parade in 1992, Johnson's body was discovered floating in the Hudson River. Police initially ruled the death a suicide, but Johnson's friends and other members of the local community insisted Johnson was not suicidal and noted that the back of Johnson's head had a massive wound. Johnson was cremated and, following a funeral at a local church, friends released Johnson's ashes over the river.`,

        description: `Howard Zinn, born on this day in 1922, was an American historian, playwright, and socialist thinker. He was chair of the history and social sciences department at Spelman College, and a political science professor at Boston University. Zinn wrote over 20 books, including his best-selling and influential book "A People's History of the United States", which was the inspiration for making this calendar.\n\nIn the 1960s, as a result of Zinn's campaigning against the Vietnam War and his influence on Martin Luther King, Jr., the FBI designated him a high security risk to the country by adding him to the Security Index, a listing of American citizens who could be summarily arrested if a state of emergency were to be declared. The FBI memos also show that they were concerned with Zinn's repeated criticism of the FBI for failing to protect blacks against white mob violence. Zinn's daughter said she was not surprised by the files; "He always knew they had a file on him."\n\nZinn described himself as "something of an anarchist, something of a socialist. Maybe a democratic socialist." He wrote extensively about the Civil Rights Movement, the anti-war movement and labor history of the United States. His memoir, You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train (Beacon Press, 2002), was also the title of a 2004 documentary about Zinn's life and work. Zinn died of a heart attack in 2010, at age 87.`,

The conflict occurred in Logan County, West Virginia as part of the "Coal Wars", a series of early-20th-century labor disputes in Appalachia. Up to 100 people were killed and nearly one thousand miners were arrested on multiple charges, including murder and treason.\n\nFor five days, from late August to early September 1921, some 10,000 armed coal miners confronted 3,000 lawmen and strikebreakers who were backed by coal mine operators during the miners' attempt to unionize the southwestern West Virginia coalfields. The battle ended after approximately one million rounds were fired, aerial bombardment of the miners, and the United States Army's arrival, intervening on orders from the president.`,

More than half of the CTA's bus drivers were African-American and for weeks they had been fighting what they considered unfair union representation.\n\nLike many other protest movements in the 50s and 60s, the drivers took as their model the Montgomery bus boycott, organizing car pools and CTW "courtesy cars" to meet the transportation shortfall in some neighborhoods. According to Standish Willis, one of the striking drivers who later wrote a college thesis on the incident, "Black drivers were being arrested while trying to close down the white stations, and we were losing what little money we had bailing them out of jail...White drivers at black stations respected the picket lines. The white drivers at the white ones did not."\n\nAccording to Willis, the strike's failure was due to the collective effort of establishment political powers working against the strike: "With the police arresting our guys, the judges putting guys in jail and holding them for contempt, and the union threatening to kick our leaders out, it was a pretty concerted attack. And we certainly didn't have enough money to get people out of jail at the rate they were putting them in."`,

When implemented, this legislation would cut 250,000 people off of medical assistance.\n\nOn this day that year, in response to this, Philadelphians living in poverty and homelessness organized through the Kensington Welfare Rights Union (KWRU), began a 140-mile march from Philadelphia to Harrisburg, the capitol of Pennsylvania. On August 31st, they arrived and camped on the front lawn of the Pennsylvania Capitol building, holding a rally there the next day.\n\nIn late September, a federal judge ordered the protesters to leave, however they defied the order, staying until they were forcibly removed by the police on October 3rd. Although the activists were able to speak with Governor Ridge, they were not successful in reversing the welfare reforms. The KWRU continued to organize protests, holding that economic rights and the right to housing, education, food, and a living wage are human rights.`,

        description: `The Dublin Lock-Out was a major industrial dispute between approximately 20,000 workers and 300 employers which began on this day in 1913, in Ireland's capitol city of Dublin. The dispute is often viewed as the most severe and significant industrial dispute in Irish history.\n\nIn the years leading up to the strike, the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union (ITGWU) had been seeking to unionize and radicalize the Irish workforce. Founded by socialist revolutionary James Larkin in 1908, the ITGWU was the first Irish union to cater to both skilled and unskilled workers.\n\nIn July 1913, three hundred businesses (led by capitalist William Martin Murphy) agreed to not allow the ITGWU to unionize the Dublin workers. Murphy dismissed hundreds of workers of suspected of union membership soon after. Employers in Dublin then locked out their workers, affecting tens of thousands of Irish workers, many of whom were already the poorest in the United Kingdom.\n\nAfter outbreaks of violence between striking workers and strike-breakers, James Connolly, Larkin and ex-British Army Captain Jack White formed a worker's militia, the Irish Citizen Army, to protect workers' demonstrations.\n\nThe lock-out eventually concluded in early 1914, when the Trades Union Congress (TUC) in Britain rejected Larkin and Connolly's request for a sympathetic strike. Most workers, many of whom were on the brink of starvation, went back to work and signed pledges not to join the ITGWU.`,

The UMWA hired Sellins and, in 1919, sent her to the Allegheny River Valley district to direct picketing by striking miners at Allegheny Coal and Coke Company.\n\nOn this day that year, she witnessed guards attacking Joseph Starzeleski, a picketing miner who was being beaten to death. When Sellins intervened, deputies shot and killed her with four bullets and used a cudgel to fracture her skull. Others said that she was attempting to protect miners' children that were on scene. Three deputies were indicted for the killings, but a 1923 trial ended in acquittal for the two men accused of her murder.`,

        description: `Black Hawk (1767 - 1838) was a band leader and warrior of the Sauk Native American tribe who surrendered to the U.S. government on this day in 1832. Although he had inherited an important historic sacred bundle from his father, he was not a hereditary civil chief.\n\nBlack Hawk earned his status as a war chief or captain by his actions; leading raiding and war parties as a young man, and then a band of Sauk warriors during the Black Hawk War of 1832, which was an apparent attempt by Black Hawk to resettle indigenous land lost in the disputed Treaty of St. Louis thirty years prior.\n\nOn August 1st, the "Battle of Bad Axe" - effectively a massacre - occurred when Sauk people attempted to surrender. Instead of accepting the surrender, American soldiers gunned them down. Many Sauk people, including children, were shot or drowned while attempting to cross the Mississippi River into safety. Although Black Hawk successfully fled the massacre, it was on this day in 1832 that he surrendered to the American government and was imprisoned.`,

        description: `In 1967, counterculture and anti-Vietnam War protest groups had been promising to come to Chicago and disrupt the Democratic Nation Convention (DNC), while the city was promising to maintain law and order. For eight days, the protesters were met by the Chicago Police Department (CPD) in the streets and parks of Chicago while the U.S. Democratic Party met at the convention in the International Amphitheater, with the protests climaxing in what a major report later said was a "police riot" this day in 1968.\n\nIt was on August 28th, that, in defiance of explicit orders by the police, thousands of protesters attempted to march on the streets of Chicago. When they did so, they were "attacked blitzkrieg fashion by busloads of club-swinging cops" and beaten and arrested en masse. According to the New York Times, "onlookers joined the protesters in booing the police. Rolls of toilet paper, bars of soap, and water glasses were thrown at the police from [Hilton] hotel windows, along with a number of rocks, bottles and cherry bombs". At least 45 protesters were treated at the hospital for injuries.\n\nOn the convention floor, several delegates made statements against Mayor Daley and the CPD, like Senator Abraham Ribicoff who denounced the use of "Gestapo tactics on the streets of Chicago" in his speech nominating George McGovern. Subsequently, the "Walker Report to the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence" assigned blame for the mayhem in the streets to the police force, calling the incident a "police riot".`,

        description: `The Swing Riots were a widespread uprising by agricultural workers in southern and eastern England that began on this day in 1830. The riots were in protest of agricultural mechanization (which displaced workers) and harsh working conditions. They began with the destruction of threshing machines in the Elham Valley area of East Kent in the summer of 1830, and by early December had spread through the whole of southern England and East Anglia, also destroying workhouses, tithe barns, ricks (hay bales), and maiming cows.\n\nHistorian J. F. C. Harrison concluded that the riots were overwhelmingly the result of the progressive impoverishment and dispossession of the English agricultural workforce over the previous fifty years. The name "Swing Riots" was derived from the pseudonym "Captain Swing", often signed to the threatening letters sent to farmers, magistrates, parsons, and others. The term "swing" was apparently a reference to the swinging stick of the flail used in hand threshing, and Captain Swing was regarded as the mythical figurehead of the rebellion.\n\nThe Swing Riots were a major influence on the Whig Government and, as a part of a wider chain of social unrest, helped pressure the government to pass the Reform Act 1832, the "Poor Law Amendment Act" of 1834, which ended "outdoor relief" in cash or kind, and the setting up of a chain of workhouses covering larger areas across the country, to which the poor had to go if they wanted help.`,

In 1857, Ulrichs was fired from his job as an administrative lawyer when his homosexuality became open knowledge. A few years later, he began publishing under his real name (possibly the first public "coming out" in modern Western society) and wrote a statement of legal and moral support for a man arrested for homosexual offences.\n\nOn August 29th, 1867 Ulrichs became the first homosexual to speak out publicly in defense of homosexuality when he pleaded at the Congress of German Jurists in Munich for a resolution urging the repeal of anti-homosexual laws. Although he was shouted down and no reform was passed, two years later the Austrian writer Karl-Maria Kertbeny coined the word "homosexual", and from the 1870s the subject of sexual orientation in the modern sense began to be widely discussed.\n\nIn Ulrichs' memory, the International Lesbian and Gay Law Association presents a Karl Heinrich Ulrichs Award for distinguished contributions to the advancement of sexual equality.`,

The speech was a defining moment of the civil rights movement and among the most iconic speeches in American history. Here is a brief excerpt:\n\n"In a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the 'unalienable Rights' of 'Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.'\n\nIt is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked "'insufficient funds.'"`,

The rebellion was in response to a debt crisis among the citizenry, as well as the state government's increased efforts to collect taxes both on individuals and their trades.\n\nThe court shut-downs continued for months, with Massachusetts politician James Warren writing to John Adams on October 22nd: "We are now in a state of Anarchy and Confusion bordering on Civil War." The organized resistance was ended by a private army, formed with funds solicited by former Continental Army General Benjamin Lincoln.\n\nShay's Rebellion also stoked some anti-democratic sentiment during the 1787 Constitutional Convention, which was dominated by strong-government advocates. Notably, Delegate Oliver Ellsworth of Connecticut argued that, because the people could not be trusted (as exemplified by Shays' Rebellion), the members of the House of Representatives should be chosen by state legislatures, not by popular vote.`,

In total, at least 12,000 members of the Slovakian anti-fascist resistance lost their lives in the fighting.\n\nThe collaborationist government also executed Slovak people suspected of aiding the rebels, particularly Jews and Roma people - at least 211 mass graves were found after the war.

Despite representing 11% of the troops in Vietnam, more than 50% of the men incarcerated at the stockade were black.\n\nOn this day in 1968, a group of black inmates approached the administration building just before midnight and attacked the guards. Chaos erupted as other inmates joined the riot. They began to set fire to buildings using kerosene stolen from the prison supply, burning the mess hall, the barber shop, latrine, administration, and finance buildings. The rioters assaulted white inmates as well as guards. Despite the violence, only four inmates escaped and one prisoner was killed.\n\nOn the effect of the riot and his detention in it, veteran Jimmie Childress told National Public Radio "I'm still angry about the way the military treated its own citizens. I still feel that something hand [sic] to be done...I guess I was just trying to prove that I was a human being. I'm over it now, but it took a long time. It took a long time."`,

On this day that year, approximately forty activists entered the Health and Welfare offices, blocked a stairwell, unfurled banners, and began chanting.\n\nThe protesters were prepared to occupy the offices for a week, and some called in sick to work to allow for this, leading one worker to get sick pay on the basis of being gay. Despite this preparation, the protesters were more or less immediately met by the new director-general of Social Security, Barbro Westerholm, who indicated she agreed with protesters and was willing to help with their cause. By October 19th, 1979, they agreed to change their diagnosis registry and remove homosexuality from the list of illnesses.`,

Workers at Pacer's, a strip club in San Diego, had unionized earlier, but were eventually decertified because of an "open shop" clause in their contract, allowing workers to become employed without joining the union.\n\nIn 2003, the workers bought the club for $400,000 with money borrowed from the old owners. After the change in ownership, the union was retained, but some changes in management were instituted. While dancers had been regularly evaluated by managers before, now a peer review process was established wherein dancers evaluate each other. The team leaders were elected from among the dancers for six month terms.\n\nLusty Lady closed in 2013 due to a failure to negotiate rent prices with their landlord, Roger Forbes (of Deja Vu Consulting Inc., which owned many clubs in San Francisco).`,

The riot is often believed to have been triggered by an assault against Majbritt Morrison, a white Swedish woman who came to the attention of local white supremacists while arguing with her Jamaican husband, Raymond Morrison. Following this incident, a white mob several hundred strong formed (associated with the racist "Teddy Boys" movement) and began to terrorize people of color in the area.\n\nOne resident, Baker Baron, born in Jamaica and a veteran of the Royal Air Force (RAF), decided to organize violent resistance to the mob violence. On this day, his force drove off a lynch mob with molotov cocktails. Here is what happened in Baron's own words:\n\n"When they told us that they were coming to attack that night I went around and told all the people that was living in the area to withdraw that night. The women I told them to keep pots, kettles of hot water boiling, get some caustic soda and if anyone tried to break down the door and come in, to just lash out with them.\n\nThe men, well we were armed...Make no mistake, there were iron bars, there were machetes, there were all kinds of arms, weapons, we had guns. We made preparations at the headquarters for the attack. We had men on the housetop waiting for them...'Let's burn the niggers, let's lynch the niggers.' That's the time I gave the order for the gates to open...I says, 'Start bombing them.' When they saw the Molotov cocktails coming and they start to panic and run.\n\n...I knew one thing, the following morning we walked the streets free because they knew we were not going to stand for that type of behaviour."`,

In this role, he founded a prominent multicultural political organization known as the "Rainbow Coalition" comprised of the BPP, the Young Patriots, the Young Lords, and an alliance among major Chicago street gangs to help them end infighting.\n\nIn 1967, Hampton was identified by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) as a radical threat. The FBI tried to subvert his activities in Chicago, sowing disinformation among these groups and placing a counterintelligence operative in the local Panthers. In December 1969, Hampton was assassinated during a predawn raid at his Chicago apartment by the Chicago Police Department. During the raid, Panther Mark Clark was also killed.\n\nAt a press conference the next day, the police announced the arrest team had been attacked by the "violent" and "extremely vicious" Panthers, and had defended themselves accordingly. In another press conference, police leadership praised the assault team for their "remarkable restraint" and "professional discipline" in not killing all the Panthers present. Photographic evidence was presented of bullet holes allegedly made by shots fired by the Panthers, but this was soon challenged. Later, it was found that all but one of nearly one hundred shots were fired by the police.`,

The FBI spread a false rumor about her pregnancy, claiming she was bearing the child of a BPP member, which was repeated frequently in the press. She was also effectively blacklisted from Hollywood films at this time.\n\nOn this day in 1979, she committed suicide, writing "Forgive me. I can no longer live with my nerves.".

        description: `The Luxembourgish General Strike was a manifestation of passive resistance that began on this day in 1942, when Luxembourg was occupied by Nazi Germany during World War II. The strikes opposed a directive that conscripted young Luxembourgers into the Wehrmacht (Nazi Army). The day prior, the leader of the Nazi Luxembourg government Gustav Simon announced that all Luxembourger males born between 1920 and 1927 were to be conscripted into the Wehrmacht to fight against the Allies.\n\nThe next day, work was virtually at a stand-still as rumors that strikes had broken out in the steel-works in the industrial south of the country and in Wiltz, a little town in the Ardennes, were eagerly discussed and spread. By September 1st, enough of the country had gone on strike that the occupying Nazi government declared a national state of emergency.\n\nWithin hours, the strike leaders were rounded up and interrogated by the Gestapo. Twenty strike leaders were summarily tried by a special tribunal, sentenced to death, transferred to the Hinzert concentration camp, and executed. Two thousand Luxembourgers were arrested, 83 were tried by the special tribunal and transferred to the Gestapo. 290 high school children, boys and girls, were arrested and sent to re-education camps in Germany.`,

        description: `In the 1930s, there was a crisis of unemployment aid and welfare not being offered to families that needed them. Sometimes, the poor resisted these conditions with direct action - crowds of jobless men and women would descend on relief offices, corner administrators, and even took over the offices until their demands were met, until money or goods were distributed to them.\n\nHistorians Harold Lasswell and Dorothy Blumenstock described one such episode that happened on this day in 1931, in Chicago, Illinois:\n\n"On the afternoon of August 31, 1931, a group of 400 persons began to march on the United Charities offices located at 4500 Prairie Avenue.\n\nBy the time they reached the relief station, the number had grown to fifteen or sixteen hundred. A speaker addressed them in front of the station, and the tension grew so high that when Joel Hunter, Chief Administrator of the Charities, asked for the selection of a committee to present the grievances of the crowd, there was a move to storm the station. A police squad arrived, and a general riot ensued."`,

        description: `The HMP Hull is a Category B men's local prison located in Kingston upon Hull in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England. On this day in 1976, the first reports of what evolved into a prison-wide revolt emerged when a group of prisoners assembled, demanding to see a fellow inmate who was on the segregation unit. Claiming the man had been assaulted, the group staged a passive sit-in and blocked a prison officer from locking a door.\n\nThe protest escalated into destruction of prison property and outright rebellion. By the next day, inmates had control of two-thirds of the jail. Over the next four days, they caused £4m worth of damage. The rebelling prisoners made three demands: one, that the deputy regional director of prisons and chairman of the board of visitors and his deputy would be present at the surrender; two, that Irish prisoners would not be singled out for special treatment, they would all be treated the same as other prisoners; three, that prisoners wanted to be received by their own officers from Hull.\n\nThese demands, along with a promise to end brutality from guards, led to the prisoners' peaceful surrender on September 3rd. Upon re-entering the prison, however, many of the prisoners were severely beaten. Hull prison itself remained closed for a year, so extensive was the damage done to it.`,

        description: `During the month of September 1920, a widespread occupation of Italian factories by their workers took place. Although originating in the auto factories, steel mills, and machine tool plants of the metal sector, the occupation/revolt spread to cotton mills and hosiery firms, lignite mines, tire factories, breweries and distilleries, and steamships and warehouses in port towns. At its height about 600,000 workers were involved.\n\nThe worker rebellion was the culmination of years of labor strife - weeks before the occupations, the Italian Federation of Metalurgical Workers (FIOM), the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), and the General Confederation of Labor (CGL) called for "obstructionism" (essentially, a work slowdown) to be applied in all the engineering factories and shipyards starting on August 21st.\n\nBy the 24th, production at the Romeo factory in Milan came to a complete standstill. A week later, production at the FIAT-Centro plant was reduced by 60%. On the morning of the 30th, the 2000 workers of the Romeo plant found the gates locked and the factory surrounded by troops. The FIOM responded by calling on its members to occupy the 300 engineering factories in Milan. Historian Lynn Williams describes what happened next:\n\n"Between the 1st and 4th of September metal workers occupied factories throughout the Italian peninsula...the occupations rolled forward not only in the industrial heartland around Milan, Turin and Genoa but in Rome, Florence, Naples and Palermo, in a forest of red and black flags and a fanfare of workers bands...Within three days 400,000 workers were in occupation. As the movement spread to other sectors, the total rose to over half a million."\n\nAlthough some radical elements within the workers' movement (Antonio Gramsci, the Italian Syndicalist Union) called for revolution, referring to the occupations as "an expropriating general strike" and demanding total socialization of the economy, more moderate forces (the CGL) prevailed, using the pressure of the rebellion to cut a deal with employers, granting better conditions to the workers on the condition of returning to work.`,

Reuther survived two attempted assassinations, including one at home where he was struck by a 12-gauge shotgun blast fired through his kitchen window.\n\nReuther was an ally of MLK Jr. and César Chavez, marching with the former on several occasions. A lifetime environmentalist, Reuther played a critical role in funding and organizing the first Earth Day on April 22nd, 1970.`,

She became a member of the United Mine Workers (UMW) and began writing protest songs like "I Am A Union Woman", "Kentucky Miner's Wife", and "Poor Miner's Farewell". When Jackson was jailed because of her unionizing activities, her husband was forced to divorce her in order to keep his mining job.\n\n In December 1931, Jackson traveled to New York City to support and raise money for striking Harlan coal miners, at one point appearing before an estimated crowd of 21,000 at the Bronx Coliseum. In the mid-1930s, she performed in New York City together with Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, Earl Robinson, and others.`,

When Rosengarten sat down to interview Ned Cobb, then 84 years old, for this purpose his memories became the book "All God's Dangers: The Life of Nate Shaw", first published on this day in 1974.\n\nCobb was the fourth of more than twenty children of a father who had been enslaved. Ned left his father's house to begin sharecropping on his own at the age of 19. Realizing that the men needed help, he joined the Alabama Sharecroppers' Union in 1931. In 1931, when the Communist Party arrived in Alabama, Cobb was profoundly impressed with them because he was aware that the party was defending the Scottsboro Boys, nine young black men accused of raping two white women.\n\nIn December 1932, a sheriff tried to take the home and livestock of one of Cobb's friends. Cobb defended his friend and in turn was involved in a shootout in which he was wounded and arrested. Cobb was sentenced to thirteen years in jail. Cobb was offered parole if he would agree to give up his farm and relocate to Birmingham. Instead, he served his full sentence and, after release in 1945, returned to his farm.\n\nCobb was one of the most successful black men in the highly Jim Crow-ed county and lived to the age of 89. He was also one of few former sharecroppers to be able to pass on property and a means of making a living to his progeny.`,

The Proclamation led directly to war with France, which concluded in the country being divided between French and self-rule at the 17th parallel.\n\nThe Proclamation quoted heavily from the American Declaration of Independence and was vehemently critical of French rule. An excerpt reads:\n\n"'All men are created equal. They are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, among them are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.' This immortal statement was made in the Declaration of Independence of the United States of America in 1776. In a broader sense, this means: All the peoples on the earth are equal from birth, all the peoples have a right to live, to be happy and free.\n\n...Nevertheless, for more than eighty years, the French imperialists, abusing the standard of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity, have violated our Fatherland and oppressed our fellow-citizens. They have acted contrary to the ideals of humanity and justice. In the field of politics, they have deprived our people of every democratic liberty...They have built more prisons than schools. They have mercilessly slain our patriots; they have drowned our uprisings in rivers of blood...They have robbed us of our rice fields, our mines, our forests, and our raw materials.\n\nFor these reasons, we, members of the Provisional Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, solemnly declare to the world that Vietnam has the right to be a free and independent country - and in fact is so already. The entire Vietnamese people are determined to mobilize all their physical and mental strength, to sacrifice their lives and property in order to safeguard their independence and liberty."`,

The riot, and resulting massacre of immigrant Chinese miners by white immigrant miners, was the result of racial prejudice toward the Chinese miners, who were perceived to be taking jobs from their white counterparts.\n\nThe Union Pacific Coal Department found it economically beneficial to give preference in hiring to Chinese miners, who were willing to work for lower wages than their white counterparts, angering the white miners. When the rioting ended, at least 28 Chinese miners were dead and 15 were injured. Rioters burned 78 Chinese homes, resulting in approximately $150,000 in property damage.\n\nMost of the Chinese population fled Rock Springs after this incident. This was only one episode of anti-Chinese violence among many; Chinese immigrants were often terrorized and discriminated against in this period of American history.`,

Today, he is perhaps best remembered for advocating the "single tax" on land (known as the Land Value Tax or LVT).\n\nGeorge also inspired the economic philosophy known as "Georgism", which is based on the belief that, although people should own the value they produce themselves, economic value derived from land and other natural resources should belong equally to all members of society. George and Karl Marx were aware of each other and feuded over conflicting ideas about the nature of capitalism.\n\nHis writing was immensely popular in 19th century America. His most famous work, Progress and Poverty (1879), sold millions of copies worldwide, probably more than any other American book before that time. The book investigates the paradox of increasing inequality and poverty amid economic and technological progress, the cyclic nature of industrialized economies, and the use of rent capture such as land value tax and other anti-monopoly reforms as a remedy for these and other social problems.`,

Due to President Roosevelt's labor reforms, union membership grew greatly leading up to the strike - the United Textile Workers (UTW), which had no more than 15,000 members in February 1933, grew to 250,000 members by June 1934, of whom roughly half were cotton mill workers.\n\nOn September 3rd, thousands of workers took the streets in Gastonia, North Carolina to form a parade celebrating Labor Day, and the next day approximately 20,000 out of the 25,000 textile workers in the county were out on strike. Hundreds of thousands of textile workers across the country soon followed suit. \n\nStrikers faced violence from both state police, private citizens, and private guards for the mills - Governor Blackwood of South Carolina announced that he would deputize the state's "mayors, sheriffs, peace officers and every good citizen" to maintain order, and accordingly, dozens of protesting workers were killed as martial law was declared and private guards fired into crowds across the country.\n\nResults of the strike were mixed, but workers in the South fared particularly badly. Thousands of striking mill workers did not return to the mills, many others were blacklisted, and some union officials claimed victory, despite worker demands not being met. Southern mill workers were in particular were extremely bitter at the union and its officials for calling off the strike and putting their faith in government boards, when the employers had conceded nothing.`,

        description: `Jean Jaurès, born on this day in 1859, was a French Socialist leader who was assassinated by a French nationalist at the outbreak of World War I. Initially a moderate republican, he was later one of the first social democrats, eventually becoming the leader of the French Socialist Party, which opposed Jules Guesde's revolutionary Socialist Party of France. The two parties merged in 1905 in the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO).\n\nToday, a key aspect his legacy was his antimilitarism. Jaurès was an early opponent of the draft and desperately tried to prevent war between France and Germany before World War I, going so far as to try and organize a general strike in both countries to force their leaders to negotiate diplomatically.\n\nIn 1914, Jaurès returned to Paris from a diplomatic meeting in Brussels to advocate against the coming war. He was assassinated by a French nationalist at the outbreak of World War I, and remains one of the main historical figures of the French Left.`,

At 20, he was the managing director of "Marcha", a storied weekly in Uruguay. Some of his high profile work as a journalist includes an interview with Juan Perón, a laudatory profile of Che Guevara, and a portrait of Pu Yi, the last emperor of China, who had just completed his Maoist reeducation in a nondescript building on the outskirts of Beijing.\n\nGaleano is perhaps best known for his book "Open Veins", which details how, through five centuries of plunder by European conquistadors and American corporations, the region's abundant natural resources had been extracted to enrich a few local elites and many foreign interests. The editors of Monthly Review Press, which published the US edition, described the book as "perhaps the finest description of the primary accumulation of capital since Marx."`,

They were among the first African-American state legislators in the United States, and 24 of the members were ministers.\n\nAfter most of the legislators voted for losing candidates in the legislature's elections for the U.S. Senate, the white majority conspired to remove the black and mixed-ethnicity members from the Assembly. On this day in 1865, the Georgia legislators voted to expel all black members of the General Assembly (4 of the 33 were allowed to stay due to being 1/8 or less black).\n\nThe expelled members appealed to the federal government and state courts. In protest of the expulsion, former representative Phillip Joiner led a 25 mile march to Camilla, the county seat on September 19th. There, they were attacked by an armed white mob, and approximately a dozen marchers were killed. The Camilla Massacre began the era of de facto voting discrimination and political disenfranchisement of the black population in Georgia.`,

Pemberton's order to not let any corn leave the state of Mississippi.\n\nThe scale of inflation was staggering - molasses, which before the war sold for less than $.30 per gallon, rose to $7.00 per gallon; the cost of a barrel of flour rose from $44.00 to more than $400.00. On this day, hundreds of rioters took to the streets, chanting "Bread or blood!", looting stores and destroying property.\n\nNotably, Confederate general Dabney H. Maury dispatched the Seventeenth Alabama Regiment to quell the riot, but the soldiers refused to intervene.`,

The strike was chronicled by labor historian Ken Weller, who authored a pamphlet discussing the strike in detail, titled "The B.L.S.P Dispute".\n\nAccording to Weller, workers were unable to get union management to address their concerns about suspected upcoming layoffs. On this day in 1961, the workers began a wildcat strike, walking off the job without union authorization. Weller states that the strike failed, undermined by the workers' own unions. Ultimately, all participating workers were fired, and the strike was broken.`,

On April 20th, 2016, the five former officers pleaded guilty to various charges related to the shooting, and in return received reduced sentences ranging from three to twelve years.

During the next three weeks, school strikes spread in a rapidly accelerating 'wave', affecting at least 62 town and cities, stretching as far north as Montrose in Scotland and as far south as Portsmouth, involving thousands of children.\n\nReasons for striking ranged from a desire to abolish the cane, less school work, more holidays, and payment for school monitors. Widespread school strikes are very rare events, with the exception of similar strikes in 1889, the scale of the 1911 strike represents a unique example of collective action by mainly working class school children.`,

The trial was unusual in the way that the prosecution did not try to demonstrate the guilt of individuals, but rather to indict the IWW as a whole, by reading inflammatory passages from seized documents; accordingly, the defense testified about the plight of the working man and the evils of capitalism.\n\nAll defendants were found guilty on all charges brought by the prosecution, and many IWW members served several years in prison. Among those convicted was the "Big Bill" Haywood, a well-known leader of the IWW, however he skipped bail before his sentencing and fled to the Soviet Union, where he would spend the rest of his life.`,

She was an unmarried teenager at the time, and was reportedly impregnated by a married man. It is widely accepted that Colvin was not accredited by the civil rights campaigners at the time due to her pregnancy shortly after the incident, with even Rosa Parks saying "If the white press got ahold of that information, they would have [had] a field day. They'd call her a bad girl, and her case wouldn't have a chance."\n\nColvin left Montgomery for New York City in 1958, because she had difficulty finding and keeping work following her participation in the federal court case that overturned bus segregation (similarly, Rosa Parks left Montgomery for Detroit in 1957). Colvin stated she was branded a troublemaker by many in her community. She withdrew from college and went on to become a nurse in Manhattan.`,

The revolt was not well-taken in the press. The Irish Times wrote "To-day Irish Labour is permeated with a spirit of revolt against all the principles and conventions of ordered society.

Several anarchists, including Emma Goldman, were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the attack, and vigilantes attacked anarchist colonies and newspapers.

Tsafendas was taken into police custody, where he was severely beaten, and then moved to a hospital where he was treated for his injuries and interviewed by a psychiatrist. Throughout his time in custody, Tsafendas was subjected to severe torture from beatings, electric shocks, mock hangings, and pretended defenestrations.\n\nAt his trial, he was declared not guilty of murder by reason of insanity. His political motivations were concealed from the proceedings. The court ordered for him to be detained "at the pleasure of the State President", which meant that only the State President (later President) had the authority to order his release. He was never discharged and tortured in custody. He died at the age of eighty-one still in custody. Less than ten people attended his funeral service..`,

When cops started pepper spraying, the picketers pushed back. ILWU McEllrath stepped forward amidst the chaos and was immediately arrested, although he was soon released after hundreds of workers surrounded the police officers.\n\nThe next day, the wrath of the rank and file rained down on EGT. Longshoremen from the major Northwest ports, Seattle, Tacoma and Portland, seeing images of the ILWU president being manhandled by cops, stopped work and began destroying EGT property. According to news reports, the cyclone fence was torn down, grain was dumped from the train cars, and the terminal was briefly occupied by angry longshore workers. Millions of dollars were lost in shipping, warning employers how far ILWU members were willing to go to protect their jobs.`,

The protests quickly spread to other companies, and by the following day somewhere between 20,000 - 30,000 workers from multiple industries were refusing to work.\n\nOn September 10th, the would-be second day of a general strike, the German Reichskommissar Josef Terboven declared martial law in Oslo and the neighboring municipality Aker and executed two union leaders, Viggo Hansteen and Rolf Wickstrøm. Three others, Ludvik Buland, Harry Vestli and Josef Larsson were also sentenced to death, but their convictions were changed to imprisonment for life in German jails. According to one eye-witness account, nearly three hundred were arrested.\n\nAfter the milk strike, the Norwegian Confederation of Unions underwent "Nazification", with members of the Fascist party "Nasjonal Samling" installed as leaders. The Nazification also applied to other parts of a civil society - the Oslo police chief, the future Prime Minister, and many university staff were also arrested in the aftermath of the strike. Th executions of Hansteen and Wickstrøm became lasting symbols of the Norwegian anti-fascist resistance.`,

In August 1966, the AWOC and the NFWA merged to create the United Farm Workers (UFW) Organizing Committee.\n\nThe Delano Grape Strike is notable for the effective implementation and adaptation of boycotts, the unprecedented partnership between Filipino and Mexican farm workers to unionize farm labor, and the creation of the UFW labor union, all of which revolutionized the farm labor movement in America.`,

His leadership style was aggressive, and the relatively moderate American Federation of Labor (AFL) sought to undermine his influence in the strike, although their efforts failed due to worker loyalty to Gold.\n\nAlthough the strike was ultimately successful due to Gold's efforts, the AFL expelled him, accusing Gold and other strike leaders of debauchery, wasting union money, bribery, forcing workers to join the Communist Party, among other grievances. Despite this, he remained a powerful figure within the organized labor of the fur industry, often competing directly with AFL-backed unions for influence among workers.\n\nGold was also a victim of anti-communist purges on many occasions. In 1950, Gold resigned from the Communist Party and signed an anti-communist oath related to the Taft-Hartley Act. The Justice Department argued that Gold had not really resigned, and indicted him for perjury in August 1953 one day before the statute of limitations ran out. Although he was successfully convicted, Gold managed to get the conviction overturned on appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court (Gold v. United States) and all charges were dropped.`,

Healy, who had been walking along the river at low tide, returned across the bridge and was apprehended by those pickets and accused of being a deserter. Upon hearing this, angry soldiers from the camp formed an angry mob and moved towards the town, failing to disperse, even after being told that Healy had been released. His arrest was merely catalyst for open rebellion after years of soldiers' discontent.\n\nThe crowd of soldiers clashed with police, who shot openly into the crowd. Open mutiny continued for days before being put down by force and mass arrests on September 12th. Corporal Jesse Short convicted of attempted mutiny and executed by firing squad. Many other soldiers received lesser punishments, ranging from demotion in rank and fines to as many as ten years in prison.`,

A railway worker and union representative by trade, he got involved in the civil rights movement in Birmingham, Alabama in the mid 1950s, working with Fred Shuttlesworth. He started a civil rights organization called the Civil Rights Guards that protected homes and business involved in the movement, usually while armed.\n\nJohnson may be best known for having helped to carry a Ku Klux Klan bomb away from Bethel Baptist Church in Birmingham, AL and serving as a bodyguard to Martin Luther King Jr. He also provided armed protection to nonviolent activists in Anniston, Alabama during the 1961 Freedom Rides, rescuing them from a segregationist mob.\n\nAn oft-repeated remark of Johnson, when asked how he'd managed to protect civil rights leaders given his commitment to nonviolence, Johnson replied, "With my nonviolent .38 special."`,

Her activities were in the trade union field and she was part of the Socio-pedagogical Missions, an initiative launched by the lecturers from the Co-operative Rural Education Institute.\n\nIn 1976, she was arrested by the military dictatorship. While being escorted by her captors, Quinteros suddenly jumped over the wall of the Venezuelan Embassy, calling out her name and asking for sanctuary. The embassy staff attempted to help her, but her captors managed to thwart the escape.\n\nA few days later, she was tortured and killed. Her kidnapping and murder grew into a major diplomatic incident that eventually culminated in Venezuela cutting off diplomatic relations with Uruguay In October 2002, Judge Eduardo Cavalli found former minister Juan Carlos Blanco primarily responsible for the disappearance of Elena Quinteros and had him arraigned on charges of deprivation of liberty.`,

Both sides fought, armed with staves, sticks and pickaxe handles. The anti-fascists also used various missiles including stones, half-bricks, knuckledusters and potatoes with razor blades inserted into them.\n\nPolice made no arrests that day. The march was an early and unsuccessful attempt by the BUF to rally support in economically depressed areas. The Battle of Stockton is remembered today as a precursor to the more famous Battle of Cable Street.`,

On the morning of September 10th, approximately 400 miners (mostly Eastern European immigrants) peacefully marched to a newly opened coal mine in Lattimer to support a new United Mine Workers (UMW) union there. After refusing an order to disperse by a Luzerne County sheriff's posse, the posse fired into the crowd. Nineteen miners were killed and several dozen were wounded.\n\nDespite the fact that sheriffs had been overhead joking about how many strikers they would kill that morning, as well as medical evidence that demonstrated miners were mostly shot in the back, the sheriff and seventy-three deputies were acquitted at trial, insisting they were charged by the crowd. The massacre was a turning point in the history of the United Mine Workers (UMW), who received more than 10,000 new members in the aftermath of the massacre.`,

McDonald's responded to the strike by offering free fries for customers who crossed the picket line and raised the hourly rate from 85p to £1.\n\nOn this day in 1979, the strike ended with a 24% pay increase and an agreement to follow Labour Court recommendations (which ultimately resulted in a recognized union for McDonald's workers). The victory was not perfect however - hours were cut back from 40 to 35 hours a week, at least one striker was not allowed to return to work, and union members were harassed on the job.`,

The clouds of gas were so thick that nearby bars had to close and streetcars refused to travel through it. By the end of the night, two people were killed and twenty-eight were injured. Face with the possibility of losing a lucrative government contract, Tetzlaff capitulated to the demands of a 40 hour work week, 25 cents per hour wage, and overtime pay to the workers, although he still refused to recognize the union.`,

Although this conclusion was supported by later investigations, speculations of Allende being murdered continue to this day.\n\nFollowing Allende's death, General Augusto Pinochet refused to return authority to a civilian government, and Chile was later ruled by a military junta that was in power up until 1990. This junta dissolved the Congress of Chile, suspended the Constitution, and began a persecution of alleged dissidents, in which at least 3,095 civilians disappeared or were killed.`,

On January 18th, 2017, the Office of the Pardon Attorney announced that President Barack Obama had denied Peltier's application for clemency.`,

He was one of Africa's foremost anti-colonial leaders, leading the nationalist movement of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde Islands and the ensuing war of independence in Guinea-Bissau.\n\nFrom 1963 until his death, he led the Partido Africano da Independência da Guiné e Cabo Verde (PAIGC) guerrilla movement against the Portuguese government, which evolved into one of the most successful wars of independence in modern African history. The goal of the conflict was to attain independence for both Portuguese Guinea and Cape Verde.\n\nCabral was assassinated on January 20th, 1973 (likely by a Portugal-backed assassin) about eight months before Guinea-Bissau's unilateral declaration of independence. Cabral's pan-Africanism and revolutionary socialism continues to be an inspiration for socialists and national independence movements worldwide.`,

Stonewall received homophobic coverage from the Village Voice, whose authors referred to the protesters with language like "blatant queens", "limp wristed", and dubbing the event "the Great Faggot Rebellion".\n\nA little over two months after the riot, the newly formed GLF tried to place two small ads in the Voice, however the Voice refused to run them, and claimed the word "gay" was profane. On this day in 1969, the GLF held their first protest, demanding a meeting with publisher Ed Fancher. The protest went on all day as Fancher stubbornly refused to meet with the group, however he eventually conceded to meet.\n\nIn the meeting, Fancher conceded the matter of the ads, and allowed the words "homosexual" and "gay" to appear in the paper; the protesters won.`,

He was a major figure in the ten-year Guatemalan Revolution, which represented some of the few years of representative democracy in Guatemalan history.\n\nÁrbenz instituted many popular reforms, including an expanded right to vote, the right of workers to organize, legitimizing political parties, and allowing public debate. The centerpiece of his policy was an agrarian reform law, under which uncultivated portions of large land-holdings were expropriated in return for compensation and redistributed to poverty-stricken agricultural laborers. Approximately 500,000 people benefited from the decree, the majority of them were indigenous people, whose forebears had been dispossessed after the Spanish invasion.\n\nOpposition to these policies caused the United Fruit Company to lobby the United States government to have him overthrown. The U.S. was also concerned by the presence of communists in the Guatemalan government, and Árbenz was ousted in the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'état engineered by the U.S. government on June 27th, 1954.`,

For two days, ships of the Royal Navy at Invergordon were in open mutiny, one of the few military strikes in British history. The rebellion was caused because of widespread pay cuts initiated by the British government, as part of its attempts to deal with the Great Depression. In the Navy this translated into a 10% pay cut for officers and senior ratings, and a 25% cut for ratings below petty officer who had joined before 1925.\n\nOn the morning of September 15th, sailors on four capital ships due to sail had already begun to refuse orders. On the Hood and the Nelson, crews carried out the ordinary harbor routine, refusing to put to sea; on the Valiant and the Rodney, crews carried out only essential duties, including the provision of safety patrols and fire guards, and did so without any recourse to their officers.\n\nBy the second day, the pay cuts had been mitigated, with the lower ranked members only receiving a 10% pay cut. A number of the organizers of the strike were jailed, while 200 sailors were discharged from the service. The mutiny caused a panic on the London Stock Exchange and a run on the pound, bringing Britain's economic troubles to a head and forcing it off the Gold Standard.`,

In October, some workers began flinging mud and destroying factory fences with axes, presumably to scare off some scabs that had replaced them. This behavior scandalized the strike and damaged some public support of it.\n\nThe strike was initially unsuccessful, but, following a similar strike in 1848, a law was passed limiting the working day to 10 hours. Unfortunately, this achievement was undercut by an amendment that allowed workers to sign a contract allowing the workday to increase back to 12 hours.`,

At the time, it was the longest strike in Canadian history (this record was broken in 2009, when workers at the same company went on strike again), and the conflict is noted as one of the most important labor disputes in Canadian history.\n\nThe conflict was caused by proposed layoffs and cuts to pay and benefits by INCO management, with low nickel prices as a justification. Around 11,600 workers were involved in the strike, which affected the wages sustaining 43,000 people, or about 26% of the population of metropolitan Sudbury. By the end of the strike, the company had been starved of over twenty-two million hours of labor.\n\nThe workers won small wage increase and a pension package, however thousands of workers lost their homes and cars because of the length of the strike. According to journalist Amy Miller, since 1979, INCO has fired 20,000 employees from their staff and now have more people receiving payments from the pension roll than pay roll.`,

Approximately 20 more people were wounded.\n\nOn May 13th, 1965, local investigators and the FBI formally named Blanton, Cash, Chambliss, and Cherry as the perpetrators of the bombing, with Robert Chambliss the likely ringleader of the four, however, they did not bring charges against any of them. Justice came later - in 1977, Chambliss was convicted of first degree murder; in 2001 and 2002, respectively, Blanton and Cherry were sentenced to life in prison.`,

        description: `In September 1954, the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (a group of Americans that voluntarily fought in the Spanish Civil War against Francoist fascists) were brought before the Subversive Activities Control Board (SACB), a United States government committee to investigate Communist infiltration of American society during the 1950s Red Scare, founded after the passage of the McCarran Act.\n\nOn this day that year, Crawford Morgan, an African-American member of VALB, testified before the SACB. Here is an excerpt of his testimony:\n\nSACB: "Did you have any understanding, Mr. Morgan, before you went to Spain, of what the issues were connected to that war?"\n\nMorgan: "I felt that I had a pretty good idea of what fascism was and most of its ramifications. Being aware of what the Fascist Italian government did to the Ethiopians, and also the way that I and all the rest of the Negroes in this country have been treated ever since slavery, I figured I had a pretty good idea of what fascism was..."\n\nSACB: "Mr. Morgan, were those thoughts in your mind before you went to Spain?"\n\nMorgan: "Ever since I have been big enough to understand things I have rebelled. As a small child of three or four years old I would rebel at human injustice in the way I understood it at that age. And as long as I have been able to remember, up until now, the government and a lot of people have treated me as a second-class citizen. I am 43 years old, and all my life I have been treated as a second-class citizen, and naturally if you always have been treated like one you start feeling it at a very tender age.\n\nWith Hitler on the march, and fascism starting the fight in Spain, I felt that it could serve two purposes: I felt that if we cold lick the Fascists in Spain, I felt that in the trend of things it would offset a bloodbath later. I felt that if we didn't lick Franco and stop fascism there, it would spread over lots of the world. And it is bad enough for white people to live under fascism, those of the white people that like freedom and democracy. But Negroes couldn't live under it. They would be wiped out."`,

Hoelz became politically radicalized by the 1917 October Revolution in Russia and by contact with Georg Schumann, a member of the socialist Spartakusbund (Schumann was later to be executed by the Nazis in 1945).\n\nIn 1920, after the right-wing Kapp Putsch, Hoelz organized workers from Falkenstein and Oelsnitz in a Red Guard, leading armed bands against the police, the army, and the far-right paramilitary Freikorps. In this role, he became a kind of "Robin Hood", raising money from employers under threat of reprisals, liberating prisoners, destroying property deeds and police archives, and burning villas of the rich.\n\nLater in life, after the Nazis began to come into power, he moved to Soviet Russia, however he became a dissident, criticizing bad conditions for the workers there. On this day in 1933, he died in a "boating accident", which is speculated to have actually been an NKVD assassination.`,

Printed in red ink on white paper, they said: "Remember, we will not tolerate any longer. Free the political prisoners, or it will be sure death for all of you." At the bottom it was signed "American Anarchist Fighters".`,

During her time there, Fish-Harnack became interested in the Soviet Union and communism, seeing them as a solution to poverty. In 1932, however, she was let go from her teaching position, as were many other women and foreigners.\n\nTogether with her husband, Fish-Harnack brought together a discussion circle which debated political perspectives on the time after the National Socialists' expected downfall. From these meetings arose what the Gestapo called the "Red Orchestra" resistance group. Beginning in 1940, the group was in contact with Soviet agents, trying to thwart the forthcoming German attack upon the Soviet Union. Fish-Harnack even sent the Soviets information about the forthcoming Operation Barbarossa.\n\nOn September 7th, Arvid Harnack and Mildred Fish-Harnack were arrested while on a weekend outing. Her last words were purported to have been: "Ich habe Deutschland auch so geliebt" ("I loved Germany so much as well"). She was the only American woman executed on the orders of Adolf Hitler.`,

Followers of the Flores Magón brothers (including Enrique and Jesus) were known as Magonistas. In 1911, the Magonistas controlled Tijuana and Mexicali for about six months as part of the "Magonista Uprising" against the state.\n\nDrawing upon the influences of early anarchist writers, such as Kropotkin, Bakunin, Goldman, and others, Ricardo was one of the major thinkers of the Mexican Revolution and the Mexican revolutionary movement in the Partido Liberal Mexicano. Flores Magón organized with the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and edited the Mexican anarchist newspaper "Regeneración". He has been considered an important participant in the social movement that sparked the Mexican Revolution.\n\nAfter his works were banned in Mexico, Ricardo fled to the United States, where he would remain for the rest of his life. Arrested multiple times, his final arrest came he was charged and convicted with sedition under the Espionage Act of 1917, and he was sentenced to twenty years for "obstructing the war effort", a violation of the Act. Magón died at Leavenworth Penitentiary in Kansas, and speculation remains today about whether he died of natural causes or was murdered by prison guards.`,

She was highly critical of the existing political system in Japan, which led her to call for an anarchism to exist in "everyday practice", namely that people should in various small ways seek routinely to undermine the kokutai (a sense of national body politic). Itō also translated anarchist writings into Japanese, including works of Emma Goldman.\n\nOn this day in 1923, Itō, Ōsugi, and his 6-year-old nephew Munekazu were arrested, strangled to death, and thrown into an abandoned well by a squad of military police known as the "Kenpeitai". The killing of such high-profile anarchists, together with a young child, became a national controversy known as the "Amakasu Incident" (named after the leader of the squad). Lt. Amakasu was arrested and sentenced to ten years in prison for the murders, however he was released after serving only three years.`,

Upon returning home, she founded a school to educate working class women called "Luisa Michel Libertarian Athenaeum".\n\nOn the day of the Chilean Sept. 11th coup (which ousted socialist president Salvador Allende and brought Augusto Pinochet into power), Flora and her son were arrested and later transferred to the Pisagua concentration camp. There, she was brutally tortured and sexually assaulted. From the wounds caused by this treatment, she died on this day in 1973, one of the many early victims of the violent political repression of the Pinochet regime.`,

        description: `Eugene V. Debs was a prominent labor organizer and socialist politician in early twentieth century America. His speeches critical of the Woodrow Wilson administration and the war earned the enmity of President Woodrow Wilson, who later called Debs a "traitor to his country". On June 16th, 1918, Debs made a speech in Canton, Ohio urging resistance to the military draft of World War I. He was arrested on June 30th and charged with ten counts of sedition.\n\nHe was found guilty on September 12th. At his sentencing hearing on the 18th, Debs gave a speech to the court that is now a classic of socialist literature. Here is a short excerpt:\n\n"Your Honor, years ago I recognized my kinship with all living beings, and I made up my mind that I was not one bit better than the meanest on earth. I said then, and I say now, that while there is a lower class, I am in it, and while there is a criminal element I am of it, and while there is a soul in prison, I am not free."`,

This law greatly expanded on racial terror of the previous Fugitive Slave Act of 1793, written with the intent to enforce Article 4, Section 2, Clause 3 of the United States Constitution, which required the return of runaway enslaved people.\n\nThe Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 compelled all authorities in free states to return fugitives of enslavement to their masters, penalizing officials who did not arrest an alleged runaway slave, preventing suspected slaves from asking for a jury trial or testifying on their own behalf, and subjecting any person aiding a runaway slave by providing food or shelter with six months' imprisonment and a $1,000 fine.\n\nThe Act was one of the most controversial elements of the 1850 compromise; abolitionists nicknamed it the "Bloodhound Bill". The political fallout from its passage is considered one of the causes of the Civil War.`,

They then left to Lagun, where they freed 22 slaves from jail and went from farm to farm, liberating more and more slaves.\n\nAfter being defeated in open battle, rebels began a guerrilla campaign, poisoning wells and stealing food. On this day in 1795, Tula and Karpata were betrayed by a fellow slave. They were taken prisoner, and the war was effectively over. After Tula was captured, he was publicly tortured to death on October 3rd that year.\n\nSlaves were granted more freedom on the island as a result of the uprising, although the system of slavery was not formally abolished until 1863. Today, August 17th is celebrated in Curaçao to commemorate the beginning of the liberation struggle. The uprising was dramatized in the 2013 Dutch film "Tula: The Revolt".`,

Union members, in the wake of the Gulf War, called on the federal government to turn its attention away from foreign affairs and to focus on domestic issues like improving health care and education and supporting workers' rights. Approximately 250,000-500,000 people took part in either event.`,

They were among the first African-American state legislators in the United States, and were expelled by the white members of the General Assembly, who claimed blacks could not hold office in Georgia.\n\nThe expelled members appealed to the federal government and state courts. In protest of the expulsion, former representative Phillip Joiner led a 25 mile march to Camilla, the county seat on this day in 1868. There, they were attacked by an armed white mob - approximately a dozen marchers were killed and 30-40 wounded. The Camilla Massacre began the era of de facto voting discrimination and political disenfranchisement of the black population in Georgia.\n\nAlthough the expelled legislators eventually won a case in the Georgia Supreme Court (White v. Clements) that gave them the right to hold office, voter intimidation and de facto voting discrimination heightened to such a degree that Georgia went almost sixty years without having a single black legislator in its state congress, although they were legally allowed to do so.`,

Women's suffrage was granted after about two decades of campaigning throughout New Zealand, led by women such as Kate Sheppard (shown above) and Mary Ann Müller.\n\nThe activists delivered a series of petitions to Parliament - over 9,000 signatures were delivered in 1891, followed by a petition of almost 20,000 signatures in 1892, and finally in 1893 nearly 32,000 signatures were presented, almost a quarter of the adult European female population of New Zealand. Through this popular pressure, a bill was passed that granted women the right to vote.\n\nIt's worth noting that, in Polynesian society (and by extension Māori people), charismatic women were given significant direct influence (although this was limited by the inability of women to speak at some meetings in community houses). As a result, some historians see colonialism as initially regressive for women's rights in New Zealand.`,

On this day, across the span of four hours, Berkman was tried, convicted, and sentenced to 21 years in prison, of which he served 14.

His descriptions of the unsanitary and inhumane conditions that workers suffered served to shock and galvanize readers. Jack London called Sinclair's book "the Uncle Tom's Cabin of wage slavery", and it caused the domestic and foreign purchases of American meat fell by half, leading to federal regulation of the meat industry.\n\nIt is worth noting that Sinclair was a racist. With the income from "The Jungle", he founded the utopian community Helicon Home Colony in Englewood, New Jersey, which excluded black and Jewish people. The colony burned down under suspicious circumstances within a year.\n\nIn the 1920s, Sinclair moved to Monrovia, California (near Los Angeles), where he founded the state's chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. In 1934, Sinclair ran in the California gubernatorial election as a Democrat. Sinclair's platform, known as the End Poverty in California movement (EPIC), galvanized the support of the Democratic Party. Sinclair gained its nomination, but was defeated by the incumbent Frank Merriam.`,

In 1804, he ordered mass killings of all the French remaining on the island, leading to the deaths of 3000-5000 French people of all ages and sexes.\n\nAfter achieving freedom from France, Dessalines imposed a strict regimen of labor on the Haitian population, leading to widespread resentment of his rule.

He was the first Prime Minister and President of Ghana, having led the Gold Coast to independence from Britain in 1957. An influential advocate of pan-Africanism, Nkrumah was a founding member of the Organization of African Unity and winner of the Lenin Peace Prize from the Soviet Union in 1962.\n\nIn 1960, Ghanaians approved a new constitution and elected Nkrumah President. His administration funded national industrial and energy projects, developed a strong national education system and promoted a pan-Africanist culture. Under Nkrumah, Ghana played a leading role in African international relations during the decolonization period.\n\nIn 1964, a constitutional amendment made Ghana a one-party state, with Nkrumah as president for life of both the nation and its party. Nkrumah was deposed in 1966 by the National Liberation Council which under the supervision of international financial institutions privatized many of the country's state corporations. John Stockwell, a former CIA agent, wrote that the CIA was intimately involved in the coup that ousted him from power.\n\nNkrumah lived the rest of his life in Guinea, of which he was named honorary co-president.`,

These agents had been working in collaboration with members of the Coordination of United Revolutionary Organizations, a U.S.-sponsored anti-Castro militant group.\n\nAccording to John Dinges, author of "The Condor Years", documents released in 2015 revealed a 1978 CIA report that proved they had knowledge Pinochet ordered the murders.

Chernyi advocated a Nietzschean overthrow of the values of bourgeois Russian society, and rejected the voluntary communes of anarcho-communist Peter Kropotkin as a threat to the freedom of the individual.\n\nAfter publishing anarchist literature, Chernyi was imprisoned in Siberia under the Russian Czarist regime for his revolutionary activities. Later, after strongly denouncing the new Bolshevik government and joining several underground resistance movements, Chernyi was eventually arrested by the Cheka (Soviet police) on a charge of counterfeiting and was executed in 1921 without trial.`,

In Radomir, they proclaimed the new "Republic in Radomir" on September 27th, 1918, and stormed the capitol Sofia the next day.\n\nThe rebels were overwhelmed by government forces, however, and they were militarily defeated within a matter of days (although it took more than a month to "pacify" the country). Despite this defeat, King Ferdinand was forced to abdicate the throne and Bulgaria formally withdrew from World War I the next year in the Treaty of Neuilly.`,

The number of participants later grew to 57,000. As the months progressed, workers from multiple industries went on strike, including lorry drivers, garbage collectors, and gravediggers. It was the largest UK labor stoppage since 1926.\n\nThe event was a disaster for the incumbent Labour Party, and they were swept out of power in the 1979 election, leading directly to the premiership of Margaret Thatcher that year.`,

The Committee issued several widely circulated "Proclamas", statements attacking the exploitation of the Puerto Ricans by the Spanish and calling for immediate insurrection.\n\nOn September 23rd, the Grito de Lares began when several hundred rebels arrived at the town of Lares, looting stores, seizing City Hall, imprisoning Spanish-born merchants, and flying the revolutionary flag of Lares at the town's church. The Republic of Puerto Rico was proclaimed and the revolutionaries offered freedom to the slaves who joined them.\n\nThe insurrection ended the next day when the Puerto Rican militia, significantly better armed than the rebels, put down the rebellion by force. Although all revolutionaries were initially sentenced to death by a military court, political pressure led the Spanish president to declare a general amnesty and free all prisoners (although the leaders of the uprising were still exiled).`,

Factories to the workers!," the International Communist League (ICL) called on the population to arm themselves and organize in councils, establishing a Popular Revolutionary Committee whose delegates issued "a declaration in which they affirmed their independence from the political parties and resolutely condemned any attempt to restrict the autonomy of the decisions taken by workers and peasants."\n\nThe Trotskyist character of the movement was at odds with the Marxist-Leninist Vietminh, however, and the revolutionary movement was caught in the crossfire between French occupiers and the opposition of the Vietminh communists.

By March 1st, 1951, the Act had excluded 54,000 people of German ethnic origin and 12,000 displaced Russian persons from entering the United States.\n\nAlthough the law is still in effect today, many of its most controversial provisions have been directly repealed or ruled unconstitutional, such as laws regarding detention of political dissidents, banning communists from working for the government, and having to register with the government. One provision still legal, however, allows the military to "regulate" weapons held by private citizens (50 U.S.C. § 797).`,

        description: `On this day in 1994, in opposition to higher water bills, activists organized a Federation of Dublin Anti-Water Charges Campaigns (FDAWCC). A protest march five hundred strong took place in the city center in November, and over the course of late 1994/early 1995 nearly every house in Fingal and South Dublin had received a leaflet from the campaign.\n\nIn response to people not paying water bills, the city declared that, if people didn't pay their outstanding bills within a certain number of days, they would begin cutting off people's water supply. In response the community followed and spied on water inspectors, in order to prevent them from shutting off the water supply to various homes.\n\nLegal action escalated, and some residents were called into court over unpaid water charges. Despite this, very few people were actually issued disconnections, and more than 50% of houses were not paying their water bills. Finally, on December 19th, 1996 the Minister for the Environment announced that the water charge would be done away with.`,

As a group, they entered a building that held documents of nine draft boards, gathered up 10,000 files, carried them to an open public space, and set them on fire with homemade napalm.\n\nThe fourteen then remained at the site, singing and reading from the gospels of John and Luke as Milwaukee firemen and police officers arrived. Similar acts of rebellion took place in protest of the Vietnam War draft. Earlier in 1968, the Catonsville Nine burned 378 draft files. In 1971, the Camden 28 attempted a similar protest, however the FBI had infiltrated their group and arrested them mid-break-in.\n\nHoward Zinn testified in support of the Milwaukee Fourteen at their trial, however he was cut off from speaking by the judge. After eleven days, the defendants were each found guilty of theft, arson, and burglary.`,

Rossi, born on this day in 1922, was a pioneering feminist and sociologist.\n\nOne of her most influential feminist articles was "Equality Between the Sexes: An Immodest Proposal", first presented as a talk in 1963. In the piece, Professor Rossi argued that for most women motherhood had become a full-time occupation, a state of affairs that hurt not only women but also the larger society in which they lived. For the well-being of both the women and the culture, she argued, parity of the sexes is essential.\n\nThe year "Equality Between the Sexes" was published coincided with the publication of The "Feminine Mystique" by Betty Friedan, another notable feminist text. Professor Rossi's argument was considered subversive at the time, and in later interviews she recalled being called a monster, an unnatural woman, and an unfit mother. In 1966, Rossi, along with Betty Friedan and others, founded the National Organization for Women (NOW).`,

Little is known of Prosser's life before the revolt that catapulted him into notoriety. Gabriel's two brothers, Solomon and Martin and his wife, Nanny, were all owned by Thomas Prosser and all participated in the insurrection.\n\nAt the time of the insurrection, Gabriel Prosser was twenty-four years old, six feet two inches, literate, and a blacksmith by trade. He was described by a contemporary as "a fellow of courage and intellect above his rank in life." With the help of other slaves, Prosser devised a plan to seize control of Richmond by killing all of the whites (except the Methodists, Quakers and Frenchmen) and then establishing a Kingdom of Virginia with himself as monarch.\n\nUnfortunately, Prosser was betrayed twice - first by his fellow slaves, who told their owner about his plan, and then by slaves in Norfolk, who turned a fleeing Prosser in to the authorities for a bounty. On this day in 1800, Prosser was captured. He was executed along with two of his brothers and 23 other slaves a few weeks later on October 6th.`,

He was a charter member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in Amite County and sought to enfranchise black Americans by encouraging voter registration.\n\nIn 1961, Lee assisted Bob Moses, a field secretary with Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), in his efforts to persuade locals to register. His activities were met with threats of reprisal by the white community, and Lee became one of the movement's earliest victims to white violence. On this day in 1961, Lee was murdered by Mississippi state representative E. H. Hurst (1908 - 1990) in broad daylight at the cotton gin while delivering cotton near Liberty.\n\nHurst killed Lee with a single shot to the head, but later claimed in court that he was defending himself after Lee attacked him with a tire iron. An all-white jury ruled that the killing was a justifiable homicide. In 1964, civil rights activist Louis Allen was killed after he informed federal investigators that his testimony in the case was forced on threat of violence.`,

Singh was an avid reader of Bakunin, Marx, Lenin, and Trotsky. He was also openly critical of Mahatma Gandhi, having become disillusioned with his non-violent praxis after Gandhi called off the non-co-operation movement.\n\nIn December 1928, Bhagat Singh and an associate fatally shot a 21-year-old British police officer, John Saunders, in retaliation for the death of Lala Lajpat Rai, a popular Indian nationalist leader who died after being attacked by police. On the run from the police, Singh was arrested when he, along with Batukeshwar Dutt, exploded two improvised bombs inside the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi, showered leaflets onto the legislators below, and allowed the authorities to arrest them.\n\nAwaiting trial, Singh gained public sympathy after he joined fellow defendant Jatin Das in a hunger strike, demanding better prison conditions for Indian prisoners. Das died from starvation in September 1929. Singh was convicted and hanged in March, 1931. Four days before his execution, Singh refused to sign a letter drafted for him that would appeal for clemency.`,

Niyogi founded "Chhattisgarh Mukti Morcha", a union run in the town of Dalli Rajhara Mines in Chhattisgarh. Because of his unionization efforts, Niyogi was repeatedly arrested, harassed, and threatened.\n\nOn September 28th, 1991, Niyogi was shot and killed in his sleep, allegedly at the instance of some industrialists who felt threatened by his struggles. His murder trial generated tremendous controversy, as a lower court awarded strict punishments to all suspects, but higher courts later convicted just one suspect and let off two industrialists implicated in the crime.`,

        description: `David Walker (1796 - 1830) was an American abolitionist, writer, and anti-slavery activist who published "An Appeal to the Coloured Citizens of the World" on this day in 1829. The piece was an early historical call for black unity in the fight against slavery.\n\nThe text was widely known and has become regarded as one of the most important political documents of the 19th century, influencing multiple generations of black leaders that came after it, including Frederick Douglass, W.E.B. Du Bois, Martin Luther King, and Malcolm X. Not surprisingly, the text infuriated southern slaveowners; the state of Georgia offered a $10,000 bounty for Walker alive and $1,000 for him dead.\n\nWalker died the next year, soon after publishing the third edition of his Appeal. Although foul play was suspected, historians consider it more likely he died of tuberculosis, which his daughter had passed away from a week prior. David Walker's son, Edward G. Walker, was an attorney and, in 1866, was one of the first two black men elected to the Massachusetts State Legislature.`,

The IWW members, along with other radical groups, were often met with opposition (violent and otherwise) from local governments and especially business leaders, in their attempts to exercise their right to free speech.\n\nOn this day in 1909, a 19 year old Elizabeth Gurley Flynn (a prominent member of the IWW) and her husband Jack Jones were arrested for speaking on a street corner in Missoula, Montana. Flynn put out the word, declaring, "we need volunteers to go to jail". IWW poured in from the surrounding territory, getting arrested and overwhelming the local jail facilities. Some were offered immediate release, but they refused and insisted on a jury trial to remain in jail.\n\nEventually, on October 8th, the city had had enough with the IWW members and dropped all charges related to the exercise of speech, allowing them to speak where they wished, provided they didn't block the flow of traffic.`,

He stated the new nation would be "a state of People's Democracy, in which, under the leadership of the worker-peasant alliance, all patriotic strata commit themselves to the destruction of the sequels of colonialism, and to annihilate the system of exploitation of man by man".\n\nOn October 19th, 1986, Machel attended a summit in Mbala, Zambia, called to put pressure on Zairean dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, over his support for the Angolan opposition movement UNITA. On his return trip to Maputo (the capitol of Mozambique), Machel's plane crashed near the Mozambican-South African border, killing him and 33 others.`,

Responding to the federal presence, a crowd of a thousand, mostly students⁠ - led by arch-conservative activist Edwin Walker⁠⁠⁠ - quickly crowded onto campus. As the night went on, the crowd swelled to 3,000 and became increasingly violent. Early the next morning, a white mob attacked Genenal Billingslea's staff car as it arrived at the university, setting it on fire with the staff inside.\n\nOn October 1st, Meredith became the first African-American student to be enrolled at the University of Mississippi. With 24-hour military security, he graduated from the university on August 18th, 1963 with a degree in political science.`,

The arrest was considered a message that the locally-unpopular law would be enforced by federal authorities.\n\nThe abolitionist Liberty Party was holding a state convention in Syracuse and, when Jerry's arrest became known, several hundred abolitionists broke into the city jail and freed him. The event came to be widely known as the "Jerry Rescue".\n\nJerry himself was hidden in Syracuse for several days, then was taken to the Orson Ames House in Mexico, New York, and from there to Oswego, before crossing Lake Ontario into freedom in Canada. Many of the prominent members of the jailbreak also fled to Canada, including Reverend J.W. Loguen and minister Samuel Ringgold Ward.`,

There, they threw rocks at the police, chanting "Kill the police!". Violence broke out, and the U.S.-led government brought in strikebreakers, declared martial law, and put down the rebellion by force with U.S. soldiers and tanks.\n\nIn total, the rebellion resulted in killing of 38 policemen, 163 civil workers, and 73 civilians. The defeat of the uprising is considered to be a turning point in establishing political control over Korea, as the PRK people's committees and the National Council of Korean Labor Unions were weakened by the suppression.`,

On this day in 1838, the first major group of Cherokee, more than 12,000 people in hundreds of covered wagons, were forced out of Tennessee, traveling westward from the town of Red Clay.\n\nTaking the journey through an unusually cold winter, they suffered terribly from exposure, disease, and starvation, killing several thousand people while en route to their new designated reserve. They were also attacked by locals and economically exploited - starving Indians were charged a dollar a head (equal to $24.01 today) to cross the Ohio River, which typically charged twelve cents, equal to $2.88 today.\n\nThe name "Trail of Tears" comes at least in part from the description of a Choctaw leader of the journey, who called it "a trail of tears and death".`,

Estimates of the amount of Haitians murdered range from 12,000-35,000.\n\nThe massacre was carried out by the Dominican Army on the orders of Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo, who initiated the violence with this statement, given on Oct. 2nd, 1937:\n\n"To the Dominicans who were complaining of the depredations by Haitians living among them, thefts of cattle, provisions, fruits, etc., and were thus prevented from enjoying in peace the products of their labor, I have responded, 'I will fix this.' And we have already begun to remedy the situation. Three hundred Haitians are now dead in Bánica. This remedy will continue."\n\nIn the following week, hundreds of Dominican troops poured into the region, killing Haitians with rifles, machetes, shovels, knives, and bayonets. Haitian children were reportedly thrown in the air and caught by soldiers' bayonets, then thrown on their mothers' corpses. Others were drowned in the sea, making identification and counting of the dead impossible.\n\nThe term "Parsley Massacre" for the genocide came from the method that Dominican soldiers would use to determine whether or not those living on the border were native Afro-Dominicans or immigrant Afro-Haitians - they would hold up a sprig of parsley to someone and ask them what it was. If the person could pronounce it the Spanish way ("perejil"), the soldiers considered them Dominican and let them live, however if they pronounced it with a French or Creole accent, they were considered Haitian and executed.`,

Notably, Catholics and Protestants set aside their differences to unite in class struggle.\n\nAfter negotiations with the relief workers fell through, they called a rent strike, lit bonfires in working class districts, and speakers from the strike committee addressed thousands. Thousands of police were called in. Over the next several days, protesters clashed in battles with police and many workers were killed and injured.\n\nWorkers won most of their demands, including big cash increases in their relief pay. One of the main demands, though, was not conceded - the giving of relief to single persons. Geehan and the other RWG members who were on the strike committee were heavily criticized for ending the strike before winning this demand.`,

It was a clash between the Metropolitan Police, sent to protect a march by members of the British Union of Fascists led by Oswald Mosley, and various anti-fascist demonstrators, including local anarchist, communist, Jewish and socialist groups.\n\nAfter it became known that the British Union of Fascists (BUF) were organizing a march to take place through the heart of the East End (an area which then had a large Jewish population), an estimated 100,000 residents of the area petitioned then Home Secretary John Simon to ban the march because of the strong likelihood of violence. He refused, and sent a police escort in an attempt to prevent anti-fascist protesters from disrupting the march.\n\nAnti-fascists built roadblocks in an attempt to prevent the march from happening, and on Oct. 4th an estimated 20,000 anti-fascist demonstrators turned out, met by 6,000–7,000 policemen (including mounted police) and 2,000–3,000 fascists. The demonstrators fought the police with sticks, rocks, chair legs and other improvised weapons. Rubbish, rotten vegetables and the contents of chamber pots were thrown at the police by women in houses along the street.\n\nThe leader of the BUF, Edward Mosley, decided to abandon the march and fascists fled through Hyde Park while the anti-fascists rioted with police. More than 150 demonstrators were arrested and approximately 175 people, including police, women, and children, were injured in the violence.`,

Freight handlers from the Southern Pacific line also struck, ending any work on the port.\n\nDuring the second week of the strike, employers launched strong attempts to create a racial break among the black and white strikers. Shippers also revived the White League, a group designed to intimidate black strikers. Despite the attempts, strikers remained united, with some unions noting that if the employers played successfully played one racial group against the other, they would all face starvation wages. The strike lasted twenty days, ending on October 24th, and striking workers won most of their demands.`,

Here is a short excerpt from the speech he gave:\n\n"Let me say to those who are listening to me now that I speak not only on behalf of Burkina Faso, my country which I love so much, but also on behalf of all those who suffer, wherever they may be.\n\nI speak on behalf of those millions of human beings who are in ghettos because their skin is black, or because they have a different kind of culture, those whose status is hardly higher than that of an animal.\n\nI suffer, too, on behalf of those Indians who have been massacred, trampled on and humiliated and who, for centuries, have been confined to reservations, so that they do not have any aspirations to any rights whatsoever, so that their culture cannot become enriched through contact with other cultures, including that of the invader.\n\nI speak out on behalf of those who are unemployed because of a structurally unjust system which has now been completely disrupted, the unemployed who have been reduced to seeing their lives as only the reflection of the lives of those who have more than themselves.\n\nI speak on behalf of women throughout the entire world who suffer from a system of exploitation imposed on them by men".`,

We are convinced that the religious bureaucracy in this country is racist, is an accomplice in this war, and is hostile to the poor." All nine were sentenced to three years in prison.`,

Hamer is credited with coining the phrase "Mississippi appendectomy" as a euphemism for the involuntary or uninformed sterilization of black women, common in the South in the 1960s.\n\nHamer was extorted, threatened, harassed, shot at, and assaulted by white supremacists and police while trying to register for and exercise her right to vote. She later helped and encouraged thousands of African-Americans in Mississippi to become registered voters, and helped hundreds of disenfranchised people in her area through her work in programs like the Freedom Farm Cooperative, which she formed to subvert state oppression of black people in the agricultural industry.`,

The strikers faced fierce opposition from law-enforcement, and the labor action became violent. In the course of the ten-day strike, 4 people were killed and 86 were wounded.\n\nAccording to communist journalist John Reed (an eyewitness to the strike action), this was the first time in industrial dispute where the police officials announced that their explicit objective was to break the strike. Multiple journalists in Bayonne criticized mainstream press as portraying the strikers and protesters as more violent than they actually were; according to Reed and others, the violence was initiated by the police themselves.`,

In response to this, a general strike was declared on March 25th.\n\nSoto and his comrades traveled along farms of the cordillera of the Andes recruiting rural workers of several large farms, driving the southeast of Santa Cruz into an uprising. They requisitioned arms and food for the campaign, granting vouchers promising to eventually return the goods and occasionally taking the landowners and managers hostage.\n\nIn the aftermath of the strike, Soto fled the country and settled in Puntas Aras, Chile. There, he managed a small hotel which served as a meeting place of libertarians, intellectuals, and free-thinkers and founded the "Centro Republicano Español". His tombstone can be found in the Cementerio Municipal de Punta Arenas.`,

The women who lived there formed the Unfair Rents Action Group, and responded to the rent raise by organizing a 14-month long rent strike.\n\nMore than 3,000 people participated in the strike, and women from a tenant organization called Merseyside Big Flame helped them organize.

While agitating for communist revolution in Bolivia, Guevara was captured by CIA-assisted state forces and summarily executed on this day in 1967.\n\nOn November 3rd, 1966, Guevara had secretly arrived in La Paz on a flight from Montevideo under the false name Adolfo Mena González, posing as a middle-aged Uruguayan businessman working for the Organization of American States. Once there, Guevara had difficulty getting co-operation from both local dissidents and the Bolivian Communist Party, despite besting the Bolivian military in several skirmishes.\n\nMany of the inhabitants willingly informed the Bolivian authorities and military about the guerrillas and their movements in the area, which led directly to Guevara's capture on October 7th, 1967. He famously shouted "Do not shoot! I am Che Guevara and I am worth more to you alive than dead!", however he remained defiant in captivity. On October 9th, on orders from the Bolivian President René Barrientos, Guevara was executed.`,

The timing of the strike was crucial, undermining new French economic goals for the railway.\n\nThe strike was organized by Ibrahima Sarr, the Federal Secretary of the Railway Union. Workers demanded housing, rights for temporary workers, wages to follow regional differences in the cost of living, and clearer standards for promotions.\n\nThe government did not respond for three months, assuming the strike would collapse due to economic pressure. Workers had prepared for this, however, taking up community collections, the community exiling strikebreaking workers, and women of the household economically sustaining families while workers were on strike.\n\nOn March 19th, the workers' union accepted a set of proposals favorable to their demands and returned to work. The strike ended with a long, celebratory march into Thiès, followed by meetings and dancing.`,

On November 10th, 1995, the Ogoni nine were hanged by the military dictatorship of General Sani Abacha.

The City Council approved the lease, but Mayor Wes Uhlman vetoed the action, causing supporters to then occupy the mayor's office. A five-year lease signed January 20th, 1973, at $1 rent annually.\n\nToday, El Centro de la Raza continues to function as an educational, cultural, and social service agency. It is considered a significant part of civil rights history in the Pacific Northwest. In 2015, El Centro de la Raza built more than one hundred moderately-priced apartments south of its main building. The apartments are designed for families making 30-60% of the average median annual income in Seattle, or $24,000 to $49,000.`,

After subduing the officers, they freed 50 other inmates and took control of the cellblock, capturing several other guards as hostages in the process.\n\nThe inmates demanded to speak to a prison reporter, Washington Claiborne. Inmates issued varying statements to him that indicated a revolutionary fervor among prisoners:\n\n"We don't want nothin' but the sidewalk. What do you think we want, better food? Bullshit. We want the sidewalk, man."\n\n"We want you to understand one thing very clearly. This is not a riot, it's a revolution."\n\n"We ain't bitches, man. We don't mind dying for the fucking cause."\n\nPrison negotiators eventually got the inmates to back off of demanding release, but only in exchange for the opportunity to go before a federal judge to air their grievances about the jail and the promise of no reprisals for their actions. The inmates got their hearing, and a new facility was built. Despite the promise of no reprisals, all nine inmates who participated in the uprising were prosecuted and convicted on various charges.`,

After a local chapter of the UMW began striking at a mine in Virden, Illinois, the Chicago-Virden Coal Company hired black strikebreakers from Birmingham, Alabama and shipped them to Virden by train.\n\nThe company hired armed detectives or security guards to accompany the strikebreakers, and an armed conflict broke out when armed miners surrounded the train as it arrived in town. A total of four detectives and seven striking mine workers were killed, with five guards, thirty miners, and an unrecorded number of strikebreakers wounded.\n\nAfter this incident, Illinois Governor John Tanner ordered the national guard to prevent any more strikebreakers from coming into the state by force. The next month, the Chicago-Virden Coal Company relented and allowed the unionization of its workers.`,

Shortly thereafter, she joined the Chinese Communist Party and almost all of her fiction from this time on was in support of its goals.\n\nDespite this, in 1957 she was denounced as a "rightist", purged from the party, and her fiction and essays were banned.

He was noted for his support of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and controversial criticism of U.S-Japanese relations, calling the United States "the shared enemy of China and Japan".\n\nOn October 12th, 160, Asanuma was assassinated by 17-year-old Otoya Yamaguchi, a nationalist, during a televised political debate for the coming elections for the House of Representatives. While Asanuma spoke from the lectern at Tokyo's Hibiya Hall, Yamaguchi rushed onstage and ran his yoroi-dōshi (a traditional samurai sword) through Asanuma's ribs on the left side, killing him. Yamaguchi was later apprehended, but killed himself in police custody.`,

The acts of protest often involved Native Americans fishing "illegally" on rivers that previous treaties, then ignored, had granted them rights to.\n\nOn this day in 1968, while conducting a Fish-in protest at Frank's Landing on the Nisqually River, activist Sid Mills was arrested. He issued a statement:\n\n"I am a Yakima and Cherokee Indian, and a man...I served in combat in Vietnam-until critically wounded...I hereby renounce further obligation in service or duty to the United States Army.\n\nMy first obligation now lies with the Indian People fighting for the lawful Treaty to fish in usual and accustomed water of the Nisqualiy, Columbia and other rivers of the Pacific Northwest, and in serving them in this fight in any way possible.\n\n...My decision is influenced by the fact that we have already buried Indian fishermen returned dead from Vietnam, while Indian fishermen live here without protection and under steady attack..."`,

In 1901, Ferrer founded the Barcelona Modern School, "Escuela Moderna", which sought to provide a secular, libertarian curriculum as an alternative to the religious dogma and compulsory lessons common within Spanish schools. His school eschewed punishments and rewards, and encouraged practical experience over academic study.\n\nIn mid-1909, Ferrer was arrested and accused of orchestrating a week of insurrection known as Barcelona's "Tragic Week". He was convicted in a show trial and executed by firing squad on October 13th, 1909. His death triggered international outcry, and his life was prominently memorialized in writing, monuments, and demonstrations across three continents.`,

In this role, he became a kind of "Robin Hood", raising money from employers under threat of reprisals, liberating prisoners, destroying property deeds and police archives, and burning villas of the rich.\n\nLater in life, after the Nazis began to come into power, he moved to Soviet Russia, however he became a dissident, criticizing bad conditions for the workers there. On September 15th, 1933, he died in a "boating accident", which is speculated to have actually been an NKVD assassination.`,

A week before his assassination, Sankara declared: "While revolutionaries as individuals can be murdered, you cannot kill ideas".`,

Many slaves did not trust the fact that a white man would be inciting them to rebel, and knew little about how to work firearms besides that. Some believed they were actually about to be sold.\n\nBrown's raid was defeated by a company of U.S. Marines, killing two of his three sons. He was convicted of treason and hanged on December 2nd, 1859.

        description: `On this day in 1985, thousands of nurses in Victoria, Australia went on an indefinite, state-wide strike for the first time in the country's history.\n\nThe strike was preceded by a breakdown in negotiations between the nurses' union, which was demanding a pay increase, and Health Minister David White. On October 11th, nurses held a meeting where they agreed to go strike the following week indefinitely.\n\nOn Oct. 17th, they picketed hospitals, handed out leaflets to people on the street, and collected money. Most of them had never been on strike before, but they stood their ground in the face of widespread media criticism and outrage from government officials.\n\nThe strike ended after five days in only a partial victory for the workers. The government agreed to co-operate on some demands regarding staffing, but lower level nurses would get no wage increases - they would have to wait for arbitration. The following year, thousands of nurses in Victoria would go on strike on October 31st, but this time for fifty days.`,

It took place in Silver City, New Mexico. Later, workers also demanded indoor plumbing and hot water for Mexican-American homes as well.\n\nEmpire Zinc fought back by sending police to harass picketers, posting eviction notices on company houses, and cutting off credit to strikers at the company grocery store. Labor activist Clinton Jencks, who was the union's business agent, was arrested on strike and kept in solitary confinement for 16 months. After the company got a court injunction forbidding picketers to return to the picket line, the workers' wives and children took their place.\n\nAfter 15 months of a protest, the company came to an agreement with the striking workers on January 21st, 1952, giving the strikers nearly everything they asked for. The strike drew national attention, and, after it was settled in 1952, a movie entitled "Salt of the Earth" (1954) was released that offered a fictionalized version of events.`,

From 1982 to 1984, Collado participated in a series of interviews with Nick Rider about anarchism in Spain during the 1930s.`,

The police department was racist on an institutional level and terrorized Algerians with violence; pro-liberation Algerians targeted and killed police with bombing campaigns.\n\nIt was in this context that the head of the Parisian police, Maurice Papon (a former Nazi collaborator later convicted of crimes against humanity) ordered police to kill Algerians, insisting that they would be protected from any consequences.\n\nUnder these orders, the French National Police attacked a demonstration by 30,000 pro-National Liberation Front (FLN) Algerians on October 17th, beating dozens to death and throwing people into the Seine river, where many drowned. After 37 years of denial and censorship of the press, the French government finally acknowledged 40 deaths in 1998, although there are estimates of 100 to 300 victims.`,

For the still-operating Columbine mine, scab workers were housed in Serene, which was fortified with barbed wire on the fences and armed guards.\n\nMass rallies had been held by workers outside the Columbine mine in Serene for several weeks and, on the morning of November 21st, miners and their families were fired upon by a militia of ex-police, armed with machine guns and tear gas. Six people were killed, and the event became known as the "Columbine Massacre".\n\nThe owner of the Rocky Mountain Fuel Company, Josephine Roche, brought an end to the strike several weeks after the incident at Columbine by declaring that the company union was to be affiliated with the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and recognizing the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA). The backbone of IWW support in the Colorado mines was broken, and the revolutionary union went into decline.`,

The Francoist government used this episode to lead a widespread crackdown on the libertarian movement, and France soon followed suit. Cerrada was exiled from the CNT for his association with these activities, but continued his work after being released from prison.\n\nOn this day in 1976, Cerrada was murdered by Ramón Benicho Canuda, a CNT Infiltrator and French Mafioso who killed Cerrada to prevent his discovery. Canuda fled to Canada after the murder, and was never charged for the crime. Named as working for a foreign power while in Toronto, Canuda subsequently disappeared.`,

While there, Bishop acquired a law degree and studied the works of Lenin, Mao Zedong, and Julius Nyerere.\n\nIn 1970, he returned to Grenada and was active politically, representing striking nurses in court and leading the "New Jewel Movement", which ultimately led him in power when, in 1979, the movement successfully led a coup against Eric Gairy and made Bishop the Prime Minister of Grenada.\n\nAmong Bishop's core principles were workers' rights, women's rights, and the struggle against racism and apartheid. Women were given equal pay and paid maternity leave, and sex discrimination was made illegal. organizations for education, health care, youth affairs, and literacy were also established. Due to his efforts, illiteracy and unemployment greatly declined.\n\nIn 1983, power struggles within the party culminated in Bishop and seven members of his cabinet being captured and executed by forces led by Bernard Coard. After his assassination, the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) and Grenada's governor-general Paul Scoon appealed to the United States for help. Within the month, Ronald Reagan launched an invasion of Grenada.`,

Although the Seminole was victorious in some of the battles of the Second Seminole War, it was on this day in 1837 that General Joseph Hernández captured Osceola, who had come to meet Hernández under the false promise of peace talks.\n\nGeneral Hernández had agreed to meet with Osceola under a white flag of truce, but promptly arrested Osceola and 81 of his followers.

The bombing was blamed on Italian anarchists, and Pinelli was detained along with many other leftists, including Pietro Valpreda, who was falsely convicted and served eighteen years in prison.\n\nJust before midnight on December 15th, 1969, Pinelli fell to his death from a fourth floor window of the Milan police station. Three police officers interrogating Pinelli, including Commissioner Luigi Calabresi, were put under investigation in 1971 for his death, but legal proceedings concluded it was due to accidental causes. Calabresi was later gunned down at his home in 1972, for which Adriano Sofri was convicted in 1997.`,

Newton were heavily inspired by the teachings of activist Malcolm X, who was assassinated in 1965. The two joined together in October 1966 to create the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense, which adopted the late activist's slogan "freedom by any means necessary" as their own.\n\nSeale and Newton founded the group to organize the black community and express their desires and needs in order to resist the racism and classism perpetuated by the system. Seale described the Panthers as "an organization that represents black people and many white radicals relate to this and understand that the Black Panther Party is a righteous revolutionary front against this racist decadent, capitalistic system."`,

Reed first gained prominence as a war correspondent during the first World War, and later became best known for his coverage of the October Revolution in Petrograd, Russia, which he wrote about in his book Ten Days That Shook the World.\n\nAs the U.S. entered World War I, Reed was marginalized for his anti-war sentiments and set sail with his partner Bryant from New York to Europe. The pair were going as working journalists to report on the sensational developments taking place in the fledgling republic of Russia. They were in Petrograd for the October Revolution. Reed was an enthusiastic supporter of the new revolutionary socialist government, and met both Leon Trotsky and Lenin while there.\n\nHe made a trip back to America, where he vehemently defended the new Soviet Republic and was arrested three times, the last for violating the Sedition Act. After being acquitted, Reed returned to the USSR and met again with Lenin and Trotsky. He died from spotted typhus while trying to return to the United States in 1920.`,

        description: `The Hungarian Revolution of 1956 began on this day in history, and was a nationwide revolution against the Hungarian People's Republic and its Soviet-imposed policies. The uprising was the first major threat to Soviet control since the Red Army drove Nazi Germany from its territory at the End of World War II in Europe.\n\nThe revolt began as a student protest, which attracted thousands as they marched through central Budapest to the Hungarian Parliament building. Protesters were fired upon from within the building by the State Security Police, killing multiple students. As the news of the violence spread, disorder and violence erupted throughout the capitol.\n\nThe rebellion spread quickly and the government collapsed. Thousands of people organized militias, battling the state police and Soviet troops. Radical workers' councils wrested municipal control from the ruling Hungarian Working People's Party and demanded political change.\n\nOn November 4th, a large Soviet force invaded Budapest and other regions of the country. Over 2,500 Hungarians and 700 Soviet troops were killed in the conflict, and 200,000 Hungarians fled as refugees. Mass arrests and denunciations continued for months thereafter, and suppression of the revolution continued for decades afterward.\n\nThese Soviet actions, while strengthening control over the Eastern Bloc, alienated many Western Marxists, leading to splits and/or considerable losses of membership for communist parties in capitalist states. At the inauguration of the Third Hungarian Republic in 1989, October 23rd was declared a national holiday.`,

The mob gathered after hearing that a policeman had been shot and a rancher killed by Chinese. Historian John Johnson has described this as the largest mass lynching in American history.\n\nAn estimated 17 to 20 Chinese immigrants were hanged by the mob in the course of the riot, but most had already been shot to death. At least one was mutilated when someone cut off a finger to get his diamond ring. Ten men of the mob were prosecuted and eight were convicted of manslaughter in these deaths. The convictions were overturned on appeal due to technicalities.`,

The women of the march called for three things: repentance for the pain of black women caused by one another, and the restoration and resurrection of African American family and community bonds.\n\nThe march, which was organized by two Philadelphia grass roots activists, Phile Chionesu and Asia Coney, enjoyed substantial turnout despite short notice and bypassing traditional leaders and organizations that had played an important role in organizing the Million Man March in 1995, such as Rev. Jesse Jackson, Louis Farrakhan, and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).\n\nNotable speakers at the event included Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, Congresswoman Maxine Waters, Sista Souljah, Jada Pinkett Smith, Attallah and Ilyasah Shabazz, the daughters of Malcolm X, and Dr. Dorothy Height. A message from Assata Shakur, living in exile in Cuba, was also read.`,

Hounslow's closure was announced in January 1977 and scheduled for August. A hospital staff occupation started as a "work-in" in March of the previous year, intent on exploiting a legal loophole where, if the hospital has patients, the law mandates the hospital be funded.\n\nManagement tried to transfer staff, and threatened those who refused with sanctions and firing. The threats did not succeed, and the work-in continued beyond the scheduled closing date.\n\nOn this day in 1977, a district team of officers raided Hounslow hospital to evict occupying workers, cutting phone lines and removing patients from the facility. Beds and furniture were wrecked, the floor strewn with food, torn mattresses, sheets, and personal articles.\n\nThus, the hospital was closed by force. The raid provoked a public outcry and led directly a year-long occupation of the closed hospital. 2000 striking hospital workers picketed the Ealing, Hammersmith, and Hounslow Area Health Authority (AHA) to protest the raid and demand that the hospital be reopened. When the occupation ended, work began on redesigning the facilities into a new community hospital/health center.`,

[He said] they are required to present identity papers and can be held as long as four hours at the police station, and sometimes their parents must come before the police will release them."\n\nThe deaths ignited pre-existing tensions in immigrant communities, particularly those of African and Arab origin, and protesters took to the street en masse. Initially confined to the Paris area, the protests and riots quickly spread throughout the country. By November 4th, thousands of vehicles had been burned, three people had been killed, and more than 2800 rioters were arrested.\n\nOn November 8th, President Jacques Chirac declared a state of emergency, which was granted a three month extension a week later.

The Youth League proposed a change in the tactics of the anti-apartheid movement, advocating boycotts, civil disobedience, strikes, and non-collaboration.\n\nIn 1960, Tambo fled South Africa due to political persecution, living in exile in north London for thirty years. From London, he supported and helped organize the ANC in the fight against apartheid from a distance. On December 13th, 1990, Tambo returned to South Africa and was elected National Chairperson of the ANC.`,

Her hometown, Arecibo, became the most unionized area of the country.\n\nIn 1908, during the FLT convention, Capetillo asked the union to approve a policy for women's suffrage, insisting that all women should have the same right to vote as men. Capetillo is considered to be one of Puerto Rico's first suffragists. Along with other labor activists, she also helped pass a minimum-wage law in the Puerto Rican Legislature.\n\nToday, Capetillo is perhaps best known for being arrested for wearing pants in public, however the charges were later dropped. In 2014, the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico honored Capetillo, along with eleven other women, with plaques in the "La Plaza en Honor a la Mujer Puertorriqueña" (Plaza in Honor of Puerto Rican Women).`,

The incident occurred after he was pulled over by Oakland cop John Frey, who called for backup after realizing who Newton was. When a second officer arrived, shots rang out; Frey was killed, while Newton and the other officer were wounded.\n\nThe "Free Huey!" campaign began in December, the phrase originating out a coalition between the BPP and the Peace and Freedom Party. The trial, which began on July 15th, 1968, quickly ascended beyond the scope of Newton himself, evolving into a racially-charged political movement. Although initially convicted of voluntary manslaughter, Huey was freed after months of appeals from his lawyer, on August 5th, 1970.`,

He was greatly inspired by Emma Goldman, and met her briefly after a lecture she gave in Cleveland. Czolgosz's direct inspiration to assassinate a national leader possibly came from the assassination of King Umberto I of Italy by anarchist Gaetano Bresci in 1900.\n\nOn September 6th, 1901, Czolgosz shot President William McKinley on the grounds of the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. McKinley died eight days later of gangrene caused by the wounds and was succeeded by Theodore Roosevelt in office. Czolgosz was tried and found guilty just over a month later. Before his execution, Czolgosz explained "I killed the President because he was the enemy of the good people - the good working people...I am not sorry for my crime".\n\nThe aftermath of the assassination saw a backlash against anarchist movements. Several anarchists, including Emma Goldman, were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the attack, and vigilantes attacked anarchist colonies and newspapers. Fear of the movement also led to government surveillance programs of anarchists, which were eventually consolidated on a federal level when the Bureau of Investigation (BOI, later to become the FBI) was formed in 1908.`,

Turner (1800 - 1831) was born and raised in Southampton County, Virginia, an area where black people outnumbered whites. He learned how to read and write at a young age and was deeply religious, eventually becoming an influential preacher in the area.\n\nIn early 1831, on the basis of religious visions, Nat Turner began preparing a slave insurrection. The rebellion began on August 21st, and rebels traveled from house to house, freeing slaves and killing many of the white people that they encountered.\n\nAt least 55 white people were killed, and the slaves killed men, women, and children. The group spared a few homes "because Turner believed the poor white inhabitants 'thought no better of themselves than they did of negroes'". The rebellion was put down by a combined force of local militia and three companies of artillery. The state executed 56 black people, and militias killed at least 100 more, some of whom were not involved in the rebellion.\n\nTurner went on the run, eluding capture for six weeks. On this day in 1831, a white farmer discovered him hidden among the local Nottoway people in a depression in the earth, created by a large, fallen tree that was covered with fence rails. After being tried and convicted for "conspiring to rebel and making insurrection", he was asked if he regretted what he had done. Turner responded "Was Christ not crucified?"\n\nHe was hanged on November 11th, 1831. After his death, state legislatures passed new laws prohibiting education of slaves and free black people, restricting rights of assembly and other civil liberties for free black people, and requiring white ministers to be present at all worship services.`,

This labor conflict ignited during 1891 when coal mine owners in the Coal Creek watershed began to remove and replace their company-employed, private coal miners then on the payroll with convict laborers leased out by the Tennessee state prison system, used in this case as strikebreakers.\n\nCoal workers at the Tennessee Coal Mining Company (TCMC) went on strike on April 1st, 1891, demanding to be paid in cash, not scrip (currency only usable at company stores) and to be allowed to check the weight of their haul (they were paid by weight, but not allowed to check the company's measurement). On July 14th, armed miners surrounded the stockades where leased convicts were held and sent them by train out of the city.\n\nAfter repeated attacks on mine property and the stockades where the prisoners were being kept, it was on this day in 1891 when the miners burned the stockades to the ground and freed the hundreds of convicts being held there. On Nov. 2nd, another band attacked stockades in a different location and freed those prisoners as well. From these two events alone, at least 453 convicts were set free.\n\nThe strike was forcibly put down by state militia, ending with the arrest of hundreds of miners. All but one were either acquitted or merely fined. Tennessee ended its policy of allowing convict labor in 1892.`,

The workers were mostly Kurdish and Turkish immigrants, as the food and textile industries were significant employers of immigrant workers.\n\nWorking conditions at the plant were difficult - according to the anarchist publication Black Flag, workers were putting in 60-70 hours per week with no overtime, sick, or holiday pay. The day before the strike, the factory manager had fired the elected shop steward in response workers' attempts to organize through the Transport and General Workers' Union (TGWU).\n\nWhen arriving to work the next day, workers refused to work, demanding the reinstatement of their elected representative. The boss then demanded union workers leave, and then fighting broke out. The union members then gathered outside the gate, some injured, where they were attacked by police.\n\nThe following day, the sacked workers and around 100 supporters again gathered outside the warehouse, attempting to block the access road and again clashing with police. The labor disputes continued for months. After two weeks, an Industrial Tribunal initiated by TGWU ruled that the workers had been sacked for union membership, and ordered them to return to work February 26th.\n\nDespite this apparent victory, when 35 workers returned to their jobs, they were told that their union would not be recognized and that they be forced to work from 5 in the morning until midnight. This caused another strike, however it was short-lived and ineffective; only twelve out of the original forty-two fired JJ workers returned to work on March 18th.`,

The strike was declared illegal by the U.S. Attorney General, A. Mitchell Palmer (the same person behind the infamous Palmer raids), who invoked the Lever Act, a wartime measure that made it a crime to interfere with the production or transportation of necessities.\n\nThe law had never been used against a union before, and in fact American Federation of Labor Samuel Gompers had been promised by President Woodrow Wilson that the Lever Act would not be used to suppress labor actions.\n\nThe strike was subject to Red Scare propaganda: coal operators made false charges that Lenin and Trotsky had ordered the strike and were financing it, and some of the press repeated those claims. Others used words like "insurrection" and "Bolshevik revolution". Because of this propaganda and the Attorney General's injunction against the strike, the UMW called the strike off on November 8th.\n\nMany strikers ignored this order, however, and the strike continued for over a month, with a final agreement being reached on December 10th. Workers won a 14% wage increase and the creation of an investigatory commission to mediate the wage issue.`,

        description: `The Alien Registration Act, popularly known as the Smith Act, is a United States federal statute that was enacted on June 28th, 1940. It set criminal penalties for advocating the overthrow of the U.S. government by force or violence and required all non-citizen adult residents to register with the federal government. Approximately 215 people were indicted under the legislation, including alleged communists, anarchists, and fascists.\n\nOn this day in 1949, the first trial of communist leaders began in Manhattan, New York. The trial, lasting ten months, was one of the longest in United States history, and took place at a fever pitch of anti-communist hysteria - the USSR tested its first nuke, communists won the Chinese Civil War, and the House of UnAmerican Activities Committee began its censorship in Hollywood, all while the trial was underway.\n\nAll eleven defendants were convicted under the Smith Act, and all five of their defense attorneys were imprisoned for contempt of court. Two were later disbarred. In the years following, more than 100 additional Communist Party USA (CPUSA) officers were convicted for violating the Smith Act, decimating the leadership of the CPUSA. The Supreme Court put an end to these types of convictions in Yates v. United States (1957), where it ruled that radical speech was protected under the 1st amendment.`,

Morrison was 31, and left behind a wife and three children.\n\nHis death was widely publicized and drew comparisons to Thích Quảng Đức and other Buddhist monks, who burned themselves to death to protest the repression committed by the South Vietnam government in years prior. In Vietnam, Morrison quickly became a folk hero to some, his name rendered as "Mo Ri Xon". On May 9th, 1967, protesters held a vigil for Morrison before occupying the Pentagon for four days until being removed and arrested.`,

After making it within 10 yards of where the nukes were stored, they were arrested by Marines at gunpoint.\n\nAfter being charged with conspiracy, trespass, destruction of property on a naval installation, and depredation of government property, the group was found guilty on December 13th, 2010. At sentencing, Judge Benjamin Settle considering releasing the defendants while they waited for their prison terms to begin, however all individuals refused and, while singing songs of peace, federal marshals escorted them out of the courtroom and into federal detention.`,

Specific examples of his policies include giving educational grants to indigenous children, literacy programs in impoverished areas, and establishing a minimum wage for workers of all ages.\n\nOn September 11th, 1973, the military moved to oust Allende in a coup d'état assisted by the Henry Kissinger and the CIA. As troops surrounded La Moneda Palace, he gave his last speech vowing not to resign. Later that day, Allende died of suicide with a gun, according to an investigation conducted by a Chilean court with the assistance of international experts in 2011.\n\nFollowing Allende's death, General Augusto Pinochet refused to return authority to a civilian government, and Chile was later ruled by a military junta that was in power up until 1990. This junta dissolved the Congress of Chile, suspended the Constitution, and began a persecution of alleged dissidents, in which at least 3,095 civilians disappeared or were killed.`,

Several hundred Panamanians crossed barbed-wire restraints and clashed with Canal Zone police and American soldiers.\n\nExtensive and violent disorder followed. A mob smashed the windows of the United States Information Agency library. The United States flag was torn from the ambassador's residence and trampled, and the U.S. embassy was attacked. Stones were thrown against the troops, who were dispersed by tear gas. The riots were a prequel to the deadlier and more prominent Flag Protest of 1964, which led to the Torrijos-Carter Treaties, which granted independence to the Canal Zone.`,

A few months later, in late October, postal workers engaged in a wildcat strike of their own, indicating a lack of trust between union rank-and-file and leadership.\n\nThe strike began when a driver in Dartford, London was sacked and 400 co-workers engaged in a spontaneous work stoppage. Within eleven days, 20,000 to 25,000 workers were out, mostly from London and the South East. More than 16 million letters per day were piling up and, after a few days, 10,000 post boxes across London were sealed off.\n\nOn November 3rd, after the management promised that there would be no repression, sackings or local deals, the strike was resolved. On the aims of the workers and why the strike was successful, one worker commented:\n\n"It was a defensive, but successful strike. The issue is we broke the anti strike legislation. In this case even the headquarters union official were not trying very hard to enforce the law and the local union reps were actively working against the law. We broke through the unions officials 'anti-strike' politics again, and we were successful when we did."`,

The bombing took place in a larger context of sporadic violence against UFW workers during the Salad Bowl strike, which was the largest farm workers strike in history when it began on August 23rd of that year.\n\nThe strike was in protest against the International Brotherhood of Teamsters winning legal jurisdiction over farm workers in California (the UFW had previously organized these workers). The Salad Bowl Strike caused the price of lettuce to double practically overnight, and lettuce growers lost $500,000 a day.\n\nThe strike also led to César Chávez, a UFW leader, to get arrested and imprisoned. When he was visited by athlete Rafer Johnson and Ethel Kennedy, widow of slain Senator Robert F. Kennedy, Johnson and Kennedy were attacked by an anti-union mob on the steps of the jail and police had to suppress a would-be riot.\n\nAlthough the strike ended on March 26th, 1971, when the Teamsters and UFW signed a new jurisdictional agreement reaffirming the UFW's right to organize field workers, jurisdictional labor disputes (and the associated violence) would continue for years afterward. These tensions led directly to the passage of the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act in 1975.`,

Through his presidential candidacies as well as his work with labor movements, Debs eventually became one of the best-known socialists living in the United States.\n\nWhile in prison for leading the Pullman Strike, Debs read various works of socialist theory and emerged six months later as a committed adherent of the international socialist movement. Debs was a founding member of the Social Democracy of America (1897), the Social Democratic Party of America (1898) and the Socialist Party of America (1901). Debs ran as a Socialist candidate for President of the United States five times, including 1900 (earning 0.6% of the popular vote), 1904 (3.0%), 1908 (2.8%), 1912 (6.0%) and 1920 (3.4%), the last time from a prison cell. He was also a candidate for United States Congress from his native state Indiana in 1916.\n\nDebs was noted for his oratory, and his speech denouncing American participation in World War I led to his second arrest in 1918. He was convicted under the Sedition Act of 1918 and sentenced to a term of 10 years. In his speech to the court, he provided one of his most well-known quotes: \n\n"Your Honor, years ago I recognized my kinship with all living beings, and I made up my mind that I was not one bit better than the meanest on earth. I said then, and I say now, that while there is a lower class, I am in it, and while there is a criminal element, I am of it, and while there is a soul in prison, I am not free."`,

He participated in a 1963 effort to desegregate Gwynn Oak Amusement Park in Maryland. As activism increased in the South, Schwerner and his wife Rita Schwerner Bender volunteered to work for National CORE in Mississippi, helping black people exercise their right to vote.\n\nMichael Scwerner and fellow civil rights workers James Chaney and Andrew Goodman were killed near the town of Philadelphia, Mississippi while investigating the burning of Mt. Zion Methodist Church, which had been a site for a CORE Freedom School.\n\nArrested by the local sheriff, the trio was released that evening without being allowed to contact anyone. On the road, they were stopped by patrol lights and two carloads of KKK members, kidnapped, tortured, and killed.\n\nThe sheriff, along with six others, were indicted and convicted for depriving the three men of their civil rights. No one was held accountable for their murders until 2005, when outspoken white supremacist Edgar Ray Killen was convicted on three counts of manslaughter.`,

In 1924, Radusch became a member of the Communist Party, and from 1929 until 1932 Radusch served as a Communist Party city councilor in Berlin.\n\nRadusch was arrested by the Nazi government on April 6th, 1933, less than a month after returning from a political trip to the Soviet Union. After refusing to sign a contrived confession, she ended up in the Barnim Street women's prison, along with around two hundred other "politicals", those identified by the Nazi government as political prisoners (distinct from "criminals").\n\nReleased in September 1933, she went on to run a restaurant with her partner Else "Eddy" Klopsch, which served as a refuge for people wanted by the Nazi regime. After the war, she became the head of the Schöneberg office dedicated to "Victims of Fascism", however she lost the job after being denounced as "lesbian".\n\nIn the 1970s, Radusch became known in the feminist movement, co-founding L74, a Berlin group of older lesbians, and editing the lesbian publication "Our Little Newspaper" ("Unserer Kleinen Zeitung").`,

It served as the county seat and headquarters of the Chinese Soviet government.\n\nOn this day in 1931, with the Soviet Union's help, the "Chinese Soviet Republic" was born, though the majority of China was still under the control of the nationalist Government of the Republic of China. On November 7th, they had an open ceremony for the new country, and Mao Zedong and other Communists attended a military parade. Claiming its own bank, printing its own money, and collecting tax through its own tax bureau, the modern Chinese Communist Party considers this the beginning of Two Chinas.\n\nThe Jiangxi-Fujian base area was defended ably by the First Red Front Army but in 1934 it was finally overrun by the Kuomintang government's National Revolutionary Army in the Fifth of its Encirclement Campaigns. This last campaign in 1934-35 precipitated the most famous of the communist army retreats known collectively as the "Long March".`,

By the following day, the Winter Palace (the seat of the Provisional government located in Petrograd, then capitol of Russia) was captured.\n\nElections were held on November 12th. In contrast to their majority in the Soviets (local council governments), the Bolsheviks only won 175 seats in the 715-seat legislative body, coming in second behind the Socialist Revolutionary Party, which won 370 seats. On its first and only day in session, the Constituent Assembly came into conflict with the Soviets, and it rejected Soviet decrees on peace and land, resulting in the Constituent Assembly being dissolved by the Bolsheviks in January.\n\nThe political situation devolved into a civil war between the Bolsheviks, the Whites (counter-revolutionaries), Makhnovists, independence movements, and other socialist factions. Eventually, the Bolsheviks defeated all rival parties militarily and formed the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) in 1922. Their victory marked the beginning of Marxism-Leninism as a global force.`,

Before 1939, only forty-one of one thousand applications actually made it to the strike stage.\n\nWar work was defined as including "the construction, execution, production, repair, manufacture, transportation, storage or delivery of munitions of war or supplies" and "the construction, remodelling, repair or demolition of defense projects." After the extension of the IDIA, the applications to strike increased six-fold, however only seven strikes (4% of the total) were allowed in the following year and a half.`,

Trotsky became more prominent from March 1918 to January 1925 as the leader of the Red Army in the post of Commissar for Military and Naval Affairs. He was also a vital leading figure in the Red victory in the Russian Civil War and one of the seven members of the first Politburo.\n\nAfter the rise of Joseph Stalin, Trotsky was removed from his positions and eventually expelled from the Soviet Union in February 1929.

Makhno was the commander of the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine, commonly referred to as the Makhnovshchina (loosely translated as "Makhno movement"). The Makhnovshchina was a predominantly peasant phenomenon that grew into a mass social movement.\n\nMakhno and his supporters attempted to reorganize social and economic life along anarchist principles, including the establishment of communes on former landed estates, the requisition and egalitarian redistribution of land to the peasants, and the organization of free elections to local soviets (councils) and regional congresses.\n\nAlthough Makhno considered the Bolsheviks a threat to the development of an anarchist Free Territory within Ukraine, he entered into formal military alliances twice with the Red Army to defeat the White Army. In the aftermath of the White Army's defeat in Crimea in November 1920, the Bolsheviks initiated a military campaign against Makhno. After an extended period of open resistance against the Red Army, Makhno fled across the Romanian border in August 1921.\n\nIn exile, Makhno settled in Paris with his wife Halyna and daughter Yelena. While there, Makhno wrote numerous memoirs and articles for radical newspapers before dying there at the age of 45 from tuberculosis-related causes.`,

Mitchell Palmer, with more than 3,000 arrested. Though 556 people were deported, including many prominent leftist leaders like Emma Goldman, Palmer's efforts were largely frustrated by officials at the U.S. Department of Labor, which had authority for deportations and objected to methods.\n\nDuring the first raid on November 7th, agents of the Bureau of Investigation working with local police executed a series of well-publicized and violent raids against the Union of Russian Workers in twelve cities. Newspaper accounts reported some were "badly beaten" during the arrests. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) was founded in direct response to this xenophobic and political persecution.`,

The general strike grew out of a strike by three unions who had joined forces to go on strike the two weeks prior. The three unions, collectively known as the "Triple Alliance", were an alliance of black and white workers. The New Orleans Board of Trade announced it would sign contracts agreeing to the terms - but only with the white unions, however this offer was steadfastly refused.\n\nEventually, other union leaders in the city began calling for a strike in support of the Triple Alliance, and, on this day in 1892, a multi-racial coalition of 25,000 workers across the entire city went on strike. Efforts by the city to find strikebreaking workers, both from within and outside of New Orleans, failed.\n\nAfter just three days, the Board of Trade agreed to binding arbitration to settle the strike, with employers agreeing to sit down with both white and black union leaders. After 48 hours of negotiations, the employers agreed to the 10-hour day and overtime pay for the Triple Alliance workers. Members of other unions also won reduced hours and higher pay.`,

She was perhaps the best-known political radical in the American Catholic Church and co-founded the Catholic Worker movement with her partner Peter Maurin.\n\nThe Catholic Worker movement started when the first issue of the Catholic Worker appeared on May 1st, 1933, priced at one cent, and published continuously since then. It was aimed at those suffering the most in the depths of the Great Depression, "those who think there is no hope for the future", and announced to them that "the Catholic Church has a social program...there are men of God who are working not only for their spiritual but for their material welfare." It accepted no advertising and did not pay its staff.\n\nLike many newspapers of the day, including those for which Day had been writing, it was an unapologetic example of advocacy journalism. It provided coverage of strikes, explored working conditions, especially of women and black workers, and explicated papal teaching on social issues. Its viewpoint was partisan and stories were designed to move its readers to take action locally, for example, by patronizing laundries recommended by the Laundry Workers' Union. Its advocacy of federal child labor laws put it at odds with the American Church hierarchy from its first issue.\n\nDay's activism continued throughout the rest of her life, resulting in multiple arrests. In the summer of 1973, she joined César Chávez in his campaign for farm laborers in the fields of California and was arrested at the age of 75 for defying an injunction against picketing, spending ten days in jail.`,

The crowded responded with by attacking sticks and stones. Three people were killed, and 31 were wounded. A monument dedicated to the victims of the violence was partially destroyed with bombs.

Within hours of Rath's death, the Kristallnacht was launched against Jewish communities in Germany.\n\nJewish homes, hospitals and schools were ransacked as attackers demolished buildings with sledgehammers. Rioters destroyed 267 synagogues throughout Germany, Austria, and the Sudetenland. Over 7,000 Jewish businesses were damaged or destroyed, and 30,000 Jewish men were arrested and incarcerated in concentration camps.

Vargas announced a new, severely authoritarian Constitution - "Estado Novo" - that effectively gave him autocratic powers.\n\nThe new government greatly expanded the power of police, persecuted political dissidents, de facto banned union activity, and allowed Vargas to rule for the next eight years under what amounted to martial law. Vargas was eventually deposed by the military in a coup launched from his own War Ministry on October 29th, 1945, after the conclusion of World War II.`,

The protest was organized by the National Union of Students (NUS) and the University and College Union (UCU), and had participation from multiple organizations across the political left, including the Labour Party, Green Party, Socialist Workers Party, Young Communist League, and Revolutionary Communist Group.\n\nThe demonstrators marched from Whitehall past Downing Street, the home of the Prime Minister, and then past the Houses of Parliament. As protesters passed the Houses of Parliament and moved towards Tate Britain for the post-march rally, several thousand people surrounded 30 Millbank in Westminster - campaign headquarters of the Conservative Party.\n\nForcing their way past the limited police presence, approximately 200 people broke in and occupied the building, while a thousand more cheered and supported them from outside. These protesters lit placards on fire, smashed windows, and vandalized the reception area. Staff working in the building were evacuated, and protesters clashed with riot police. Fourteen people had to be hospitalized and fifty-four were arrested, the majority of them students.`,

They demanded recognition of their union, higher wages, equal pay for women, and a safer workplace.\n\nJust three days later, on November 13th, workers at the meatpacking plant ended their labor action, winning some of their demands. Although the wage increase was not as high as strikers wanted, the newly recognized union acquired prestige among workers in the plant. Frank Ellis recalled that, following the decision of the Industrial Commission, workers rushed to join the union, a boon to the new and unstable IUAW.`,

On this day in 1995, the Ogoni nine were hanged by the military dictatorship of General Sani Abacha. Saro-Wiwa's execution provoked international outrage, and resulted in Nigeria's suspension from the Commonwealth of Nations for over three years.`,

It began as a peaceful rally in support of workers striking for an eight-hour work day and turned into a massacre after an unknown person threw a dynamite bomb at the police.\n\nIn the internationally publicized legal proceedings that followed, eight anarchists were convicted of conspiracy. Seven were sentenced to death and one to a term of 15 years in prison. Illinois Governor Richard J. Oglesby commuted two of the sentences to terms of life in prison; another committed suicide in jail rather than face the gallows.\n\nOn this day in 1887, the remaining four defendants, George Engel, Adolph Fischer, Albert Parsons, and August Spies, were hanged. At the gallows, they sang the "Marseillaise", then the anthem of the international revolutionary movement. Family members who attempted to see them for the last time, including notable anarchist Lucy Parsons, were arrested.\n\nAccording to witnesses, in the moments before the men were hanged, Spies shouted, "The time will come when our silence will be more powerful than the voices you strangle today." Parsons then requested to speak, but he was cut off when the signal was given to open the trap door.`,

While in exile, he wrote several key works, including "History of the Russian Revolution" (1930) and "The Revolution Betrayed (1936)", a critique of the Soviet Union under Stalin's leadership in which he argued that the Soviet state had become a "degenerated workers' state" controlled by an undemocratic bureaucracy.\n\nHe eventually settled in Mexico City, continuing to advocate for his ideas and against Stalin's power.

Silkwood is most known for raising concerns about corporate practices related to health and safety in the Kerr-McGee Cimarron Fuel Fabrication Site in Oklahoma.\n\nAs an employee of Kerr-Mcgee, Silkwood made plutonium pellets and was the first woman on the union's negotiating team. After investigating her workplace, she found several health code violations and later testified to the Atomic Energy Commission about her concerns for the handling of radioactive materials at work. Shortly before her death, Silkwood's body contained 400 times the legal limit of plutonium.\n\nOn this day in 1974, while en route to meet a New York Times journalist and union official, Silkwood died in a crash where her car ran off the road. She had just left a union meeting at the Hub cafe in Crescent and was seen with a binder full of documents. None of the documents were found at the scene of the crash.\n\nAlthough foul play was not conclusively proven, skid marks from Silkwood's car were present on the road, suggesting that she was trying to get back onto the road after being pushed from behind. Investigators also noted damage on the rear of Silkwood's vehicle that was not present before the accident, and microscopic examination of the rear of Silkwood's car showed paint chips that could have come only from a rear impact by another vehicle.\n\nSilkwood's family sued Kerr-McGee on grounds of negligence, and Kerr-McGee eventually settled out of court for $1.38 million, admitting no liability. Kerr-McGee closed its nuclear fuel plants in 1975.`,

        description: `The Athens Polytechnic Uprising began on this day in 1973 with a massive student demonstration against the governing Greek military junta. An assembly formed during the protest elected to occupy the Polytechnic School, which lasted for three days before being forcibly ended by a military-scale attack by the government.\n\nThe uprising had popular support, with thousands of Athenians flooding into the streets to support their anti-government protest. The occupying students demanded the restoration of democracy in Greece, and were shot at by government snipers set up around the building. On November 17th, the state finally broke through erected barricades by sending a tank crashing through the gates of the Polytechnic.\n\nAlthough the state claimed no students were killed, there were at least 24 recorded deaths, and many estimates are much higher. Although the rebellion was crushed at first, it caused political instability that ultimately led to the regime's downfall in 1974. Greek schools commemorate the uprising annually on November 17th.`,

The officers went in with tear gas and water cannons and fought squatters for nearly six hours through a block-long stretch of Mainzer Strasse. Gangs of squatters on rooftops, some masked, bombarded police officers with cobblestones and gasoline bombs while the police retaliated with tear gas and water cannons.\n\nAccording to the NY Times, the squatters, mostly from western Berlin and western Germany, had first fought with the police late Monday night, then constructed a veritable fortress throughout the area, digging deep ditches with a stolen excavator, stringing barbed wire and storing stones, gasoline bombs and railroad flares as weapons.\n\nOn the evening of November 14th, thousands of squatters and their supporters marched through Berlin to protest the action. The government claimed that at least 85 people, including 70 police officers, were injured, and 350 people were taken into custody.`,

The workers were preparing for Pharoah Ramses III's thirty-year jubilee, a lavish celebration in his honor, years in advance.\n\nThe payment to the workers at Deir el-Medina (also known as Set-Ma'at, "The Place of Truth") was inconsistent before finally stopping altogether. After 18 days of non-payment, workers laid down their tools and marched toward the city shouting "We are hungry!".\n\nAfter negotiations for back pay broke down, the workers took over the southern gate of the Ramesseum, the central storehouse of grain in Thebes. After winning their back pay, wages continued to be paid inconsistently and workers again went on strike, taking over and blocking all access to the Valley of the Kings, which disrupted important religious ceremonies.\n\nThese labor actions went on for three years; the workers would not receive their pay, they would then go on strike, the officials would find the means to pay them, and the same scenario would be repeated again the next month.`,

Before November 14th, some of the activists had initiated a hunger strike to protest the conditions of the prison, the prison doctors force-fed the women by putting tubes down their throats, causing some women to vomit.\n\nOn the night of November 14th, prison guards beat Lucy Burns and chained her hands to the cell bars above her head for the entire night. They threw Dora Lewis into a dark cell and beat her unconscious. Her cellmate, Alice Cosu, who believed Lewis to be dead, suffered a heart attack, and was refused medical treatment. Dorothy Day (famous for later founding Catholic Worker Movement) was slammed repeatedly over the back of an iron bench. Guards grabbed, dragged, beat, choked, pinched, and kicked other women.\n\nThe suffragists dubbed the episode the "Night of Terror", and the brutality was highly publicized, garnering support for the movement to give women the right to vote. On January 9th, 1918, President Woodrow Wilson (who had been specifically targeted by suffragette pickets) finally announced his support for the proposed women's suffrage amendment.`,

Beal was convicted and skipped bail, fleeing to the Soviet Union. There, he became ambivalent about the state of the Bolshevik revolution and sought to return to the United States.\n\nAfter successfully fleeing to his home country, Beal changed his mind once more, returning to the Soviet Union and working as a manager in a Ukrainian tractor factory. It was here that he became disillusioned for good with the communist system, noting bitterly that he was still a labor organizer, facing Soviet versions of the same issues that had prompted the North Carolinians to strike, only now he was urging workers not to demand better conditions.\n\nUpon returning to the U.S., he became an anti-communist critic, publishing his experiences in a book titled "Proletarian Journey". After serving four years in prison, he was paroled and began working at a textile mill, participating in union activities there. He died on November 15th, 1954, of a heart attack.`,

Trolley and public utility workers initiated the labor action, inspired by a successful railroad workers' strike in nearby Durán. Their demands were initially modest (safer working conditions, more timely pay), but grew more amibitous as the strike war on (the creation of an artificial exchange rate to manage severe currency inflation).\n\nThe strike became city-wide on November 13th, and the Ecuadorian government called on the military to suppress it. On November 15th, 1922, more than 20,000 demonstrators gathered in downtown Guayaquil and marched towards the police station. When they arrived, they were fired upon by soldiers at the station. Approximately three hundred protesters died, either by gunshot or from being stabbed by bayonets. For most workers, this incident was the end of the strike, however many of their demands, including an exchange rate moratorium and wage increases for trolley workers, were conceded.`,

Shortly thereafter, Myasnikov was expelled from the Russian Communist Party, and he formed an opposition faction called "Workers Group of the Russian Communist Party" that opposed the New Economic Policy (NEP).\n\nMyasnikov was arrested by the Soviet state in 1923, and served several years in prison before being exiled to Armenia, where he fled the country. In 1944, he accepted an invitation by the Soviet embassy in France to return to the USSR. Upon his arrival, he was arrested by the Soviet secret police and later executed on November 16th, 1945.`,

The Jesuits were deemed "subversives" that needed to be eliminated, and officers attempted to disguise the operation as a rebel attack, using an AK-47 rifle that had been captured from the FMLN.\n\nAfter storming their residence and killing the priests, soldiers also executed housekeeper Julia Elba Ramos and her 16-year-old daughter, Celina Mariceth Ramos. The murders increased international pressure for a cease-fire and became one of the key turning points that led toward a negotiated settlement to the war.`,

The local hospital would not treat black people, and Harry died on the way to the nearest one that would, 30 miles away in Sanford, Florida. Harriette died from her wounds nine days later, on January 3rd, 1952, at the same hospital. Their deaths were two of the earliest assassinations in the civil rights movement.\n\nAlthough the Federal Bureau of Investigation investigated their murders, no one was ever prosecuted.

        description: `On this day in 1909, President William Howard Taft sent U.S. warships to take position against the elected government of Nicaraguan President José Santos Zelaya. Taft's administration had close relations with U.S. corporations operating in Nicaragua. Those corporations were opposed to the way Zelaya defended the economic interests of his country and the region from exploitation by U.S. businesses.\n\nThe U.S. moved to remove President Zelaya after he executed two American citizens who had conspired to commit a revolution against the government. Despite the fact that Zelaya proposed a commission made up of Mexicans and Americans come to Nicaragua to investigate the executions, promising to resign if it found him guilty of any wrongdoing, President Taft ordered warships to approach both Nicaraguan coasts and marines to assemble in Panama.\n\nZelaya fled the country, stating that he would "give no pretext" to American hostilities. His successor José Madríz was eventually forced to resign by the American forces, and followed Zelaya into exile. Historian Stephen Kinzer has written the following about event:\n\n"This was the first time the United States government had explicitly orchestrated the overthrow of a foreign leader. In Hawaii, an American diplomat had managed the revolution, but without specific instructions from Washington. In Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines, American 'regime change' operations were part of a larger war. The overthrow of President Zelaya in Nicaragua was the first real American coup."`,

The demonstration has been staged annually since 1990 to call for the closure of what participants call the "School of Assassins".`,

Hill, an immigrant worker frequently facing unemployment and underemployment, became a popular songwriter and cartoonist for the union.\n\nHis most famous songs include "The Preacher and the Slave", "There Is Power in a Union", and "Casey Jones - the Union Scab", which describes the harsh lives itinerant workers, and call for them to organize to improve their working conditions.\n\nIn 1914, John G. Morrison, a Salt Lake City area grocer and former policeman, and his son were shot and killed by two men. The same evening, Hill arrived at a doctor's office with a gunshot wound, and briefly mentioned a fight over a woman.\n\nHe refused to explain further, even after he was accused of the grocery store murders on the basis of his injury. Hill was convicted of the murders in a controversial trial and executed on this day in 1915, despite widespread calls for clemency, including from President Woodrow Wilson and Helen Keller.\n\nAfter his arrest, Hill wrote the following about his case: "Owing to the prominence of Mr. Morrison, there had to be a 'goat' [scapegoat] and the undersigned being, as they thought, a friendless tramp, a Swede, and worst of all, an IWW, had no right to live anyway, and was therefore duly selected to be 'the goat'."`,

This group lived on the island together until the protest was forcibly ended by the U.S. government. The group claimed that, under the Treaty of Fort Laramie between the U.S. and the Lakota tribe, all retired, abandoned, or out-of-use federal land was returned to the Indians who once occupied it.\n\nBy late May of 1971, the government had cut off all electrical power and all telephone service to the island. Left without power, fresh water, and in the face of diminishing public support and sympathy, the number of occupiers began to dwindle. On June 11th, 1971, a large force of federal officers removed the remaining 15 people from the island.`,

At his dental office, Dr. Hayling taught them methods of nonviolent activism. He arranged picketing and sit-ins at white-only restaurants, and wade-ins at a white-only pool and beach, and was arrested many times for his activism, as well as being assaulted by the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nAs he gained a reputation for militance, Hayling was threatened with the revocation of his local NAACP chapter's charter by Executive Secretary Roy Wilkins. Hayling replied, "I will mail you your charter", and vowed to continue his activities without the support of the NAACP.\n\nDr. Hayling is also remembered for this quote: "I and the others have armed. We will shoot first and answer questions later. We are not going to die like Medgar Evers." Dr. Hayling died in 2015, at the age of 86.`,

The militia was armed with machine pistols, rifles, riot guns and tear gas grenades.\n\nThe workers were fired upon after a dispute on whether or not they could enter the town of Serene.

Initially supportive of the Bolshevik revolution, Berkman and Goldman soon became disillusioned, voicing their opposition to the Soviets' use of terror after seizing power and their repression of fellow revolutionaries.\n\nAmong Berkman's most notable works are "Prison Memoirs of an Anarchist" (1912), an account of his 14 years in prison after attempting to assassinate Frick; "The Bolshevik Myth" (1925), describing his experiences in Bolshevist Russia from 1920 to 1922; "Now and After: The ABC of Communist Anarchism" (1929), which anarchist Stuart Christie called "among the best introductions to the ideas of anarchism in the English language".`,

In a show of force the next day, Dacus marched through the town accompanied by white supporters and allies in the labor movement. The SPLL then murdered four of those white allies, including one American Federation of Labor (AFL) district representative. Dacus and his family were able to escape to New Orleans.\n\nThis incident was part of a larger period of civil unrest known as the American Red Summer of 1919, including massacres and riots in Elaine, Arkansas, Chicago, Washington D.C., Knoxville, Tennessee, Wilmington, Delaware, and other cities.`,

The violence at union rallies during the strike prompted Larkin to call for a workers' militia to be formed to protect themselves against the police. For the duration of the lock-out was armed with hurleys and bats to protect workers' demonstrations from the police.\n\nIn 1916, it took part in the Easter Rising, an armed insurrection aimed at ending British rule in Ireland. Despite the relatively small size of the army, it was more organized than the larger Irish Volunteers, with its members receiving superior training and being less affected by factional and ideological division. The ICA became involved in the War of Independence, taking responsibility for parts of Dublin and aiding the Irish Republican Army (IRA) in various operations.`,

The sugar cane workers, determined to unionize for a living wage, had chosen to strike during the crucial harvest season, during which there was a narrow window of time to harvest the cane and the planters would be unlikely to find strikebreakers.\n\nJudge Taylor Beattie, an ex-Confederate soldier and slaveowner, declared martial law and gathered up hundreds of white men to form a paramilitary group to suppress the strikers, close the borders to the city, and monitor all movement of black people in the area. Not wanting to be boxed in, black strikers fired on the city border guards. In retaliation, the paramilitary forces initiated three days of violence against mostly unarmed black workers and their families.\n\nEstimates of the total number of dead range from 35-60, making it one of the deadliest strikes in American labor history. Despite the women and children killed, the Southern press heralded the white perpetrators of the violence. One participant, Andrew Price, went on to be elected to Congress. Black farmworkers did not make a large effort to unionize again until the 1940s.`,

He is best known for his co-authorship of the authoritative compendium "American Slavery As It Is: Testimony of a Thousand Witnesses", published in 1839.\n\nHarriet Beecher Stowe partly based Uncle Tom's Cabin on Weld's text, and it is regarded as second only to that work in its influence on the antislavery movement. Weld remained dedicated to the abolitionist movement until slavery was ended by the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1865.`,

        description: `Andrew Goodman, born on this day in 1943, was an American social worker who was one of three civil rights activists who were murdered during the Freedom Summer of 1964 by members of the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nIn 1964, Goodman volunteered along with fellow activists Michael Schwerner, his wife Rita Schwerner Bender, and James Chaney to work on the "Freedom Summer" project of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) to register black people to vote in Mississippi. In mid-June, Goodman joined Schwerner in Meridian, Mississippi, where the latter was designated head of the field office. They worked in rural areas on registering blacks to vote.\n\nGoodman and fellow civil rights workers Michael Schwerner and James Chaney were killed near the town of Philadelphia, Mississippi while investigating the burning of Mt. Zion Methodist Church, which had been a site for a CORE Freedom School.\n\nArrested by the local sheriff, the trio was released that evening without being allowed to contact anyone. On the road, they were stopped by patrol lights and two carloads of KKK members, kidnapped, tortured, and killed.\n\nThe sheriff, along with six others, were indicted and convicted for depriving the three men of their civil rights. No one was held accountable for their murders until 2005, when outspoken white supremacist Edgar Ray Killen was convicted on three counts of manslaughter.`,

It was the largest strike by female American workers up to that date and was led by Clara Lemlich and the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, also supported by the National Women's Trade Union League of America (NWTUL).\n\nThe industry working conditions preceding the strike were atrocious - work weeks of 65 hours were normal, and in season they might expand to as many as 75 hours. Despite low wages, workers were often required to buy their own materials, including needles, thread, and sewing machines.\n\nIn February of 1910, the NWTUL settled with the factory owners, gaining improved wages, working conditions, and hours. The end of the strike was followed just a year later by the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire, which exposed the plight of immigrant women working in dangerous and difficult conditions and boosted participation in the garment unions.`,

From 1927 to 1928, Ba Jin lived in France, meeting many anarchists, including Alexander Berkman, translating some of his works.\n\nBa Jin was persecuted by Mao's Cultural Revolution - he was forced to rewrite some of his works accommodate state dogma and his wife died while being denied medical care by the government. He was officially rehabilitated by the government in 1977 and went on to serve as chairman of the Chinese Writers' Association.\n\n"Only by not forgetting the past can we be the master of the future." - Ba Jin`,

One the four sisters - Patria, Minerva, María Teresa, and Dedé - only Dedé survived, dying of natural causes in 2014.\n\nTo organize against the state, Minerva, María Teresa, and Patria began distributing pamphlets about the many people whom Trujillo had killed, and obtained materials for guns and bombs for use when they eventually openly revolted. The sisters called themselves "Las Mariposas" ("The Butterflies"), after Minerva's underground name. For their acts of subversion, María, Minerva, both of their husbands, and Patria's husband were all imprisoned.\n\nAfter being freed, Patria, Minerva, María Teresa, and their driver, Rufino de la Cruz were attacked after visiting María's and Minerva's incarcerated husbands. On the way home, the sisters and de la Cruz were separated, strangled, and clubbed to death. The bodies were then gathered and put in their Jeep, which was run off the mountain road in an attempt to make their deaths look like an accident.\n\nThe assassinations turned the Mirabal sisters into "symbols of both popular and feminist resistance", according to the New York Times. In their honor, the United Nations General Assembly designated the 25th of November as "International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women" in 1999.`,

In 1917, he hailed the Russian Revolution as the beginning of that global revolution and had correspondence with Lenin on multiple occasions, wishing him well and asking for his support in condemning Dutch social democrats for not condemning American imperialism. Lenin sent Gorter a copy of "State and Revolution" in response, which Gorter then offered to translate.`,

The Free Territory was an attempt to form a stateless anarchist society during the Ukrainian Revolution of 1917 to 1921. It existed from 1918 to 1921, during which time "free soviets" and libertarian communes operated under the protection of Nestor Makhno's Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army (flag shown above).\n\nAs Makhnovia self-organized along anarchist principles, references to "control" and "government" are highly contentious. For example, the Makhnovists, often cited as a form of government (with Nestor Makhno as their "leader"), played a purely military role, with Makhno himself functioning as little more than a military strategist and advisor. The economy of Makhnovia was market socialist and anarcho-communist in character (depending on the region) - where money was used, production was organized in the form of worker cooperatives.\n\nThe Bolsheviks were openly hostile to the Free Territory. On November 26th, 1920, less than two weeks after the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army assisted Bolshevik forces in defeating the White Army, Makhno's headquarters staff and many of his subordinate commanders were arrested at a Red Army planning conference to which they had been invited by Moscow, and executed. Nestor Makhno fled the region several months later, settling in Paris, France.`,

He was killed by Dan White, a disgruntled former city supervisor.\n\nDuring Milk's short time in office, he sponsored a bill banning discrimination in public accommodations, housing, and employment on the basis of sexual orientation. After his death, Milk became an icon in San Francisco and a martyr for the gay community.`,

His father owned large textile factories in Barmen and Salford, England. His revolutionary predilections (and later, his atheistic beliefs) put him at odds with his family, who expected Engels to inherit the family business.\n\nEngels' career became intertwined with Marx's when he began writing articles for "Rheinische Zeitung", a German newspaper that Karl Marx edited. In 1845, Engels published "The Condition of the Working Class in England", based on personal observations and research of poverty and disease in English cities. In 1848, Engels co-authored the "Communist Manifesto" with Marx.\n\nLater, Engels supported Marx financially, allowing him to perform research and write "Das Kapital". After Marx's death, Engels edited the second and third volumes of "Das Kapital". Additionally, Engels organized Marx's notes into "Theories of Surplus Value", which were later published as the fourth volume of "Das Kapital". In 1884, he published "The Origin of the Family", Private Property and the State", based on Marx's ethnographic research.`,

Faye was spared for her ability to develop photographs, and the Nazis ordered Faye to develop their photographs of the massacre. Later, she cited taking a photo of her dead family in a mass grave as the impetus to take up arms.\n\nDuring a partisan raid on the camp, Faye fled to the forests and joined the Molotava Brigade, a partisan group mostly comprised of escaped Soviet Red Army POWs. She was accepted because her brother-in-law had been a doctor and they were desperate for anyone who knew anything about medicine. Faye served the group as a nurse from September 1942 to July 1944, even though she had no previous medical experience.\n\nDuring another raid on the Lenin ghetto, Faye succeeded in recovering her old photographic equipment. During the next two years, she took over a hundred photographs, developing the medium format negatives under blankets and making "sun prints" during the day. While on missions, Faye buried the camera and tripod to keep it safe. Schulman is the only known Jewish partisan photographer from this era.\n\n"I want people to know that there was resistance. Jews did not go like sheep to the slaughter. I was a photographer. I have pictures. I have proof." - Faye Schulman`,

        description: `The Sand Creek Massacre was a massacre of Cheyenne and Arapaho people by the U.S. Army that occurred on this day in 1864, as part of the First Nations Wars.\n\nIt began when a 675-man force of the Third Colorado Cavalry attacked and destroyed a village of Cheyenne and Arapaho people in southeastern Colorado Territory, killing and mutilating hundreds of indigenous people, about two-thirds of whom were women and children. This violence took place despite the fact that Black Kettle, a chief known for choosing policies of peace with the colonizers, was flying an American flag and white flag over his lodge to forestall any possible attack.\n\nTwo officers of the attacking forces, Captain Silas Soule and Lieutenant Joseph Cramer refused to obey the order to attack the camp. The rest of the soldiers charged however, killing all present, regardless of age. The soldiers killed children and took trophies, cutting off the fingers, ears, noses, and testicles of the fallen as keepsakes.\n\nChief Ochinee (One-Eye) managed to escape from the camp, but, seeing the massacre unfolding, returned to die with his people. A survivor of the massacre, a 24-year old indigenous woman named Mochni, became a warrior afterward, and participated in raids against colonizers until her incarceration and death. Many others, who had previously supported peace, joined the Dog Soldiers, an indigenous group that engaged against guerilla warfare against the state and would-be settlers on their land.`,

        description: `The Seattle WTO protests, sometimes referred to as the Battle of Seattle, were a series of large anti-globalization protests that began on this day in 1999. Protesters surrounded the WTO Ministerial Conference, which was to be the launch of a new millennial round of trade negotiations. The negotiations were quickly overshadowed by the massive street protests outside the hotels and the Washington State Convention and Trade Center, estimated to have more than 40,000 participants.\n\nThe protests were a mix of permitted rallies and marches (involving the ALF-CIO) and direct action from anarchists and other political radicals. By noon, the opening ceremony of the conference had been canceled due to protest control and vandalism of intersections downtown, and that night the mayor declared a state of emergency. Police began gassing and arresting people indiscriminately, sometimes targeting bystanders who weren't participating in the protests. By December 1st, 500 people had been jailed.\n\nTo many in North American anarchist and radical circles, the Seattle WTO riots, protests, and demonstrations were viewed as a success - prior to the "Battle of Seattle", almost no mention was made of "anti-globalization" in the US media, while the protests were seen as having forced the media to report on 'why' anybody would oppose the WTO. Controversy over the city's response to the protests resulted in the resignation of the police chief of Seattle, Norm Stamper.`,

He was lauded as the "greatest humorist [the United States] has produced", and William Faulkner called him "the father of American literature". After 1899, he was also a committed anti-imperialist and anti-racist.\n\nBefore 1899, however, he supported imperialism, calling the Spanish War "the worthiest" war the U.S. ever fought. In the New York Herald, he described his anti-imperialism epiphany like this:\n\n"I wanted the American eagle to go screaming into the Pacific ... Why not spread its wings over the Philippines, I asked myself? ... I said to myself, Here are a people who have suffered for three centuries. We can make them as free as ourselves, give them a government and country of their own, put a miniature of the American Constitution afloat in the Pacific, start a brand new republic to take its place among the free nations of the world. It seemed to me a great task to which we had addressed ourselves."\n\n"But I have thought some more, since then, and I have read carefully the treaty of Paris [which ended the Spanish-American War], and I have seen that we do not intend to free, but to subjugate the people of the Philippines. We have gone there to conquer, not to redeem."\n\nFrom 1901 until his death in 1910, Twain was vice-president of the American Anti-Imperialist League, which believed that there is a fundamental contradiction between the ideas upon which the American republic was founded and designs for colonial expansion being advanced by the nation's contemporary political leaders.`,

He was among the group that came to be known as the Chicago Eight, which included future California state senator Tom Hayden and Black Panther Party co-founder Bobby Seale.\n\nAs a prominent dissident and leader of the counter-culture movement, Hoffman's personal life drew a great deal of surveillance from the Federal Bureau of Investigation - its file on him was 13,262 pages long. He committed suicide in 1989.`,

The Air Force responded by committing him to a psychiatric hospital, and he was subsequently declared to have a 10% mental disability and discharged.\n\nAfterward, Clements became a trained physician, connecting the struggle for social justice to his medical practice. After learning of the U.S.-backed death squads in El Salvador, Clements traveled to an area controlled by the Salvadoran guerrilla resistance group Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN), to care the wounded.\n\nDr. Clements has served as president of both the Unitarian Universalist Service Committee and Physicians for Human Rights, a US-based not-for-profit that uses medicine and science to document and advocate against mass atrocities and severe human rights violations around the world.`,

On her grandmother's influence, Chisholm later stated "Granny gave me strength, dignity, and love. I learned from an early age that I was somebody. I didn't need the black revolution to tell me that."\n\nIn 1968, she became the first black woman elected to the United States Congress in an upset victory where she defeated civil rights activist James Farmer. Her campaign slogan, later the title of her autobiography was "Unbought and Unbossed". She represented New York's 12th congressional district for seven terms from 1969 to 1983. In the 1972 United States presidential election, she became the first black candidate for a major party's nomination for President of the United States.`,

The rest occupied the city's most dilapidated and dangerous buildings, many of which had long since been declared unlivable.

As early as 1943, Parks exited the bus rather than to give up her seat but continue riding. Parks said, "My resisting being mistreated on the bus did not begin with that particular arrest. I did a lot of walking in Montgomery."\n\nThe National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), for whom Parks worked as a secretary, believed that she was the best candidate for seeing through a court challenge because she was perceived as a responsible, mature woman with a good reputation. Accordingly, the NAACP bailed her out of jail after her arrest.\n\nDue to economic sanctions used against activists, Parks lost her job at the department store, and her husband quit his job after his boss forbade him to talk about his wife or her legal case. Parks was convicted in a local trial within a week of her arrest, and the appeals process was greatly slowed by the state government of Alabama. From the economic pressure of the Montgomery Bus Boycott, eventually the city conceded and reversed its segregation bus laws.`,

Although Carter initially suspended aid to the regime, he later reinstated it and President Reagan continued this support.\n\nAfter the release of declassified documents in the 1990s, New Jersey congressman Robert Torricelli stated that it was "now clear that while the Reagan Administration was certifying human rights progress in El Salvador they knew the terrible truth that the Salvadoran military was engaged in a widespread campaign of terror and torture".`,

Among the many accounts of the violence, N. Farmakis, a teenaged member of the Anti-EAM "Organization X" testified that he saw the head of the police Angelos Evert giving the order to open fire on the crowd by means of a handkerchief waved from the window.\n\nThe massacre marked the beginning of the "Dekemvriana" ("December Events" in English), a period of fighting between the EAM and the British Army and its collaborators. The Dekemvriana broke the power of the EAM, with 13,000 members of the EAM arrested and transferred by the British to concentration camps. The massacre and its aftermath were important events in the lead up to the Greek Civil War of 1946.`,

        description: `Fred Hampton was a revolutionary socialist and chairman of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party who was assassinated by the Chicago PD on this day in 1969.\n\nAside from serving as chairman of the Illinois chapter, Hampton also served deputy chairman for the national Panther party. In this capacity, he founded the Rainbow Coalition, a multi-racial class-conscious organization that initially included the Black Panthers, the Young Patriots, and the Young Lords, as well as an alliance among major Chicago street gangs to help them work for social change rather than fight amongst each other.\n\nIn 1967, Hampton was identified by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) as a radical threat. The FBI tried to subvert his activities in Chicago, sowing disinformation among these groups and placing a counterintelligence operative in the local Panthers.\n\nOn December 4th, 1969, Hampton was assassinated in his bed during a predawn raid at his Chicago apartment by a tactical unit of the Cook County State's Attorney's Office, in conjunction with the Chicago Police Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. During the raid, another Panther, Mark Clark, was killed and several more were seriously wounded.\n\nAt a press conference the next day, the police announced the arrest team had been attacked by the "violent" and "extremely vicious" Panthers and had defended themselves accordingly. In a second press conference on December 8th, the police leadership praised the assault team for their "remarkable restraint", "bravery", and "professional discipline" in not killing all the Panthers present.\n\nPhotographic evidence was presented of bullet holes allegedly made by shots fired by the Panthers, but this was soon challenged by reporters. It was later found that all but one of nearly 100 shots were fired by police.\n\nHis death was ruled a justified homicide at the time, although a civil lawsuit filed on behalf of the survivors and the relatives of Hampton and Clark won $1.85 million dollars in damages in 1982.`,

The leader of the local NAACP chapter, E.D. Nixon, used her arrest to launch a bus boycott to try and change the city's bus policies.\n\nThe boycott had widespread support in the black community, and black taxi drivers lowered their fares to match the cost of taking a bus in solidarity. In response, the membership of the "White Citizen's Council" increased dramatically.\n\nMany acts of terrorism were committed by whites in response to the boycott - the homes of Martin Luther King Jr. and Ralph Abernathy were firebombed, boycotters were often physically attacked, and dozens of activists were arrested.\n\nThe boycott ended on December 20th of 1956, when the city passed an ordinance allowing black members to sit where they wanted on the bus. The campaign of white terrorism continued, however, and all within the month that followed integration on buses, multiple churches were bombed, buses were subject to sniper fire, and at least one black man was lynched.`,

Two hundred and forty local union members voted to have a sit-in at the end of the week. They carefully organized the action, dividing into three shifts to manage and clean the factory equipment, provide security, and communicate with the media and supporters 24 hours a day.\n\nProtesting workers displayed signs that said "No More Bailouts for the Ruling Class!" and "You got bailed out, We got sold out". The action won national attention, and eventually the corporation changed ownership, and all workers were able to keep their jobs.\n\nRichard Gillman, the former CEO of Republic Windows and Doors, was convicted of stealing more than $500,000 from the company, fined $100,000 and sentenced to four years in prison. On May 30th, 2012, some members of the local union founded the New Era Windows Cooperative with the help of The Working World, an organization that finances worker cooperatives.`,

A few months earlier, 8,000 workers held management hostage and placed gas cylinders on the roof of the building, threatening to blow the factory up if their wages were not paid.\n\nThe December 6th riots became violent when fights broke out between private security and the workers; police intervened by shooting into the crowd of workers. Although official numbers listed 11 dead workers, others have claimed more than 100 people died. 300 workers disappeared in the aftermath of the violence. Both sources provided below state that the government's figures are false, and that the police shooting was completely unjustified.`,

As a result of severe labor shortages in Taranto, Italy, the West Indians had to carry out arduous physical tasks, unloading ships and cleaning toilets for white soldiers. Black members were also not allowed to have a rank higher than Sergeant, and white soldiers were given a pay raise while black soldiers were not.\n\nUnder these conditions, the men of the 9th Battalion revolted and attacked their black officers. The mutiny lasted four days. Approximately 60 soldiers were tried for mutiny and those convicted received sentences ranging from three to five years, although one was executed by firing squad.\n\nIn the aftermath of the crushed rebellion, an organization called the "Caribbean League" was formed by West Indian soldiers. When one sergeant stated "the black man should have freedom and govern himself in the West Indies and that if necessary, force and bloodshed should be used to attain that object" at a meeting, he was loudly applauded by the majority of those present.\n\nThe soldiers decided to hold a general strike for higher wages on their return to the West Indies. A secret memo written by the British government in 1919 recognized the revolutionary sentiments among the soldiers: "Nothing we can do will alter the fact that the black man has begun to think and feel himself as good as the white."`,

The actual number may be higher because workers would often take family members (including children) into the mines to help with their work.\n\nThe disaster was caused by an explosion that occurred in Fairmont Coal Company's No. 6 and No. 8 mines which destroyed the ventilation shafts and caused the roof to collapse. Rescue attempts were greatly hindered because the air was not fit to breathe - rescuers could not be in the mine for more than fifteen minutes at a time. Only one worker was rescued, another four escaped.\n\nChief Mine Inspector James W. Paul concluded that Fairmont Coal Company was operating within the bounds of state law. The disaster was one of the contributing events that led to the creation of the United States Bureau of Mines.`,

An outspoken opponent of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, which he saw as an act of American imperialism, in 1967 Chomsky rose to national attention for his antiwar essay "The Responsibility of Intellectuals".\n\nAssociated with the New Left, he was arrested multiple times for his activism and placed on President Richard Nixon's Enemies List. Chomsky, along with Howard Zinn, was also on a list of American citizens that could be arrested without probable cause in the event of a national emergency.\n\nIn collaboration with Edward S. Herman, Chomsky later theorized a propaganda model of mass media in their work "Manufacturing Consent" (1988).`,

        description: `Pyotr Kropotkin, born on this day in 1842, was a Russian scientist, historian, and anarchist theorist, known for his writings on mutual aid and advocation of anarcho-communism.\n\nBorn into an aristocratic land-owning family, he attended a military school and later served as an officer in Siberia, where he participated in several geological expeditions. He was imprisoned for his activism in 1874 and managed to escape two years later. He spent the next 41 years in exile in Switzerland, France (where he was imprisoned for almost four years) and in England.\n\nWhile in exile, Kropotkin gave lectures and published widely on anarchism and geography. He returned to Russia after the Russian Revolution in 1917 but was disappointed by the Bolshevik state. Kropotkin's funeral was one of the last public demonstrations of anarchists in the USSR, with funeral marchers carrying anti-Bolshevik slogans and Emma Goldman delivering a speech.\n\nKropotkin was a proponent of a decentralized communist society free from central government and based on voluntary associations of self-governing communities and worker-run enterprises. He wrote many books, pamphlets, and articles, the most prominent being "Fields, Factories and Workshops", "Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution", and "The Conquest of Bread".\n\n"We must recognize, and loudly proclaim, that every one, whatever his grade in the old society, whether strong or weak, capable or incapable, as, before everything, THE RIGHT TO LIVE, and that society is bound to share amongst all, without exception, the means of existence at its disposal." - Peter Kropotkin`,

She draws upon anarchist theory as well as Quechua and Aymara cosmologies in her writings.\n\nCusicanqui has been critical of what she calls the "political economy of knowledge". She condemns scholars who are now in positions of power both home and abroad; accusing them of "building a small empire within an empire", appropriating the contributions of Global South scholars for their own gain without a meaningful dialogue with their counterparts.\n\nShe is also an activist who works directly with indigenous movements in Bolivia, such as the Katarista movement and the coca growers movement.`,

The Society for Human Rights also published the earliest-documented homosexual periodical, Friendship and Freedom. Although Gerber (shown above) founded the group, a black clergyman named John T. Graves was its first president, with Gerber serving as a director.\n\nGerber set out to expand the Society's membership beyond the original seven but had difficulty interesting anyone other than poorer gays in joining. More affluent members of Chicago's gay community refused to join his society, not wanting to ruin their reputations by being associated with homosexuality.\n\nThe Society was only a chartered organization for a few months before police arrested Gerber and several other members. After their arrests, the Chicago Examiner reported the story under the headline "Strange Sex Cult Exposed".\n\nGerber was subjected to three highly publicized trials, and his defense, while ultimately successful, cost him his life savings. Unable to continue funding the Society, the group dismantled, and Gerber left for New York City, embittered that none of the wealthier gays of Chicago had come to his aid for a cause he believed was designed to advance the common good.`,

The massacre was carried out by units of the Salvadoran army's Atlacatl Battalion, which was created in 1980 at the U.S. Army's School of the Americas.\n\nSoldiers separated the population of el Mozote into men, women, and children, and began by torturing and executing the men. Girls as young as 10 were raped, and they murdered the children by cutting their throats and hanging them from trees. At least one child killed in this way was reportedly two years old.\n\nThe NY Times and Washington Post reporters who broke the story in early 1982 were heavily criticized, and both the U.S. and Salvadoran governments denied or downplayed the incident. Officials of the Reagan administration called them "gross exaggerations" and as late as 2001, U.S. official Elliott Abrams said that Washington's policy in El Salvador was a "fabulous achievement."\n\nIn December 2011, the government of El Salvador formally apologized for the massacre.`,

The deaths were caused by an explosion, so large it shook houses for three miles, in the mines, trapping workers inside.\n\nThe Oaks was a notoriously dangerous mine, and ten years earlier the 400-strong workforce had gone on an unsuccessful ten-week strike because of management incompetence. On the day of the explosion, 340 people, adults and children, were underground.\n\nMultiple rescue attempts were made over the following days, however they had to be abandoned because of continuing explosions within the mine. A 29-strong party led by mine engineer Parkin Jeffcock was killed during one of the rescue operations. No one was ever held accountable for the death of the workers or the dangerous work conditions of the Oaks Colliery.`,

Giuseppe Pinelli, an anarchist railway worker, died after falling from the fourth-floor window of the police station where he was being held. Anarchist Pietro Valpreda was falsely convicted and served 18 years in prison.\n\nOrdine Nuovo committed the attacks to prevent the country falling into the hands of the left-wing by duping the public into believing the bombings were part of a communist insurgency. They also had assistance from the state - General Gianandelio Maletti, the head of SID (Servizio Informazioni Difesa) obstructed the investigation and withheld information from one of the trials. Maletti also destroyed a report implicating Ordine Nuovo and arranged for potential witnesses to leave the country before fleeing himself to South Africa.`,

The massacre itself occurred that December when British Troops surrounded a rubber plantation at Sungai Rimoh near Batang Kali in Selangor and gunned down 24 unarmed adult men. The only adult male survivor was a man named Chong Hong, who fainted and was presumed dead.\n\nDespite several investigations by the British government since the 1950s, and a re-examination of the evidence by the Royal Malaysia Police between 1993 and 1997, no charges were brought against any of the alleged perpetrators. As recently as 2018, the European Court of Human Rights declared one appeal for justice as inadmissible on the grounds that it took place too long ago.`,

Eventually, this disagreement caused De Leon to leave the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) entirely.\n\n"We Socialists are not reformers; we are revolutionaries. We Socialists do not propose change forms. We care nothing for forms. We want a change of the inside of the mechanism of society, let the form take care of itself." - Daniel De Leon`,

Foner's three brothers were also fired, and he became blacklisted from working in academia.\n\nToday, Foner is perhaps most strongly remembered for his works "A History of the Labor Movement of the United States" and "The Life and Writings of Frederick Douglass", both completed while he was excluded from formal academic work.`,

She founded the Working Women Guild to fight for better health and social services in Dundee, securing a membership of over 300, and was heavily involved in October 1934 with the National Unemployed Workers Movement county march to Forfar, to lobby the County Council. She was also a songwriter, writing "mill songs" about the working-class mill workers of Dundee.`,

        description: `Sitting Bull (c. 1831 - 1890) was an indigenous leader of resistance against the United States government who was killed by Indian agency police on this day in 1890. Sitting Bull was Lakota, and formed cross-tribal alliances in his efforts to resist the process of colonization. Sitting Bull also steadfastly refused to become dependent on the U.S. government.\n\nOn June 25th, 1876, Colonel Custer and his forces were wiped out at the battle of Little Big Horn. Sitting Bull did not take part in the battle, but acted as a kind of spiritual leader to those who did, performing the Sun Dance, in which he fasted and sacrificed over 100 pieces of flesh from his arms, a week prior. Following this battle, the U.S. government sent thousands of soldiers to the area, causing many Lakota to surrender.\n\nIn 1890, due to fears that Sitting Bull would use his influence to support the Ghost Dance movement (a movement of indigenous resistance), Indian Service agent James McLaughlin ordered his arrest. Early on the morning December 15th, 39 police officers and four volunteers approached Sitting Bull's house. The camp awakened and men converged at the house.\n\nWhen Sitting Bull refused to comply, the police used force on him, enraging the Sioux in the village. Catch-the-Bear, a Lakota, shouldered his rifle and shot one of the Indian agents, who reacted by firing his revolver into the chest of Sitting Bull. In 1953, his Lakota family exhumed what were believed to be his remains, reburying them near Mobridge, South Dakota, near his birthplace.`,

He organized young anarchists in the "Gioventu Libertaria" (Libertarian Youth) in 1962 and helped found the "Sacco and Vanzetti anarchist association" in 1965.\n\nA few days before Pinelli's death, Italian fascists from the "Ordine Nuovo" orchestrated a bombing campaign in Milan; one bomb in Piazza Fontana killed 17 people and injured 88. The bombing was blamed on Italian anarchists, and Pinelli was detained along with many other leftists, including Pietro Valpreda, who was falsely convicted and served eighteen years in prison.\n\nJust before midnight on December 15th, 1969, Pinelli fell to his death from a fourth floor window of the Milan police station. Three police officers interrogating Pinelli, including Commissioner Luigi Calabresi, were put under investigation in 1971 for his death, but legal proceedings concluded it was due to accidental causes. Calabresi was later gunned down at his home in 1972, for which Adriano Sofri was convicted in 1997.`,

He then joined the Korea Justice Corps, later becoming the general commander of the Northern Military Administration Office Army and playing a key role in the "Battle of Cheongsanri" against japanese forces.\n\nIn 1928, the Korea Independence Party was formed, and the following year, when the Korean General Association was established as the successor of the new people, Chwa-chin was designated as the President. During this process, conflicts between the nationalist and communist independence activists intensified. On January 24th, 1930, Kim was assassinated by Park Sang-sil, an agent of the Japanese colonial government.`,

        description: `Joseph Stalin, born on this day in 1878, was a Marxist-Leninist revolutionary and politician who led the Soviet Union from the mid-1920s until his death in 1953.\n\nBorn to a poor family in modern day Georgia, Stalin joined the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party as a youth. He edited the party's newspaper Pravda and raised funds for Vladimir Lenin's Bolshevik faction via robberies, kidnappings, and protection rackets. After the Bolsheviks seized power during the 1917 October Revolution, Stalin joined its governing Politburo and assumed leadership over the country following Lenin's 1924 death.\n\nThrough the Five-Year Plans developed under his leadership, the Soviet Union collectivized its agricultural sector and rapidly industrialized, creating a centralized command economy. This rapid change caused disruptions in food production that were a factor in the famine of 1932 - 1933. Despite this, the first five-year plan greatly increased the country's productive capacity.\n\nStalin's legacy is polarizing among leftist thinkers and movements. Although the Soviet Union under his leadership succeeded in rapidly industrializing Russia, helping end Russian monarchial rule, defeating fascist movements in Europe, and opposing American imperialism, his reign was marred by severe political repression, suppression of labor movements, episodes of ethnic cleansing during the Great Purge of 1937-38, and the criminalization of homosexuality.\n\nShortly after Stalin's death, the Soviet Union went through a period of "de-Stalinization". His successor, Nikita Khrushchev, gave a series of remarks titled "On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences" (also known as the "Secret Speech") to a closed session of the national congress, denouncing Stalin's political repression and the cult of personality that surrounded him.`,

The main trial lasted until 1961, when all of the defendants were found not guilty.\n\nA few weeks earlier, on December 5th, 1956, the South African Police's Security Branch raided and arrested 140 people from around the country on the charge of treason as they enforced the Suppression of Communism Act.\n\nAn attempt by the prosecutor to proceed with the case was interrupted three times by the noise of 5,000 Black South Africans, who, hoping to attend the trial, surrounded the streets of the Drill Hall and sung the hymn "Nkosi Sikeleli Afrika".`,

In 1973, he was appointed to the position of Prime Ministers. Six months into his term, he was assassinated by the ETA while returning from mass at San Francisco de Borja church.\n\nFor five months, the ETA members dug under the street from a rented out basement near his route. On the day of the attack, members disguised as electricians were present on the scene to trigger detonation.\n\nIn a collective interview justifying the attack, the ETA bombers said Carrero Blanco "symbolized better than anyone else the figure of 'pure Francoism' and without totally linking himself to any of the Francoist tendencies..." and called him "a man without scruples".\n\nThe assassination had far-reaching political implications, and is credited with helping Spain become more democratic. Carrero Blanco's successor, Carlos Arias Navarro, promised liberalizing reforms, including the right to form political associations. Franco himself died in 1975, and elections in Spain were held in 1977, with a new constitution being approved the following year.`,

The Cherokee Nation sued the state of Georgia and lost; on appeal, the Supreme Court declined to rule on the case.\n\nA year later, the Supreme Court ruled that the Cherokee Nation was a sovereign entity and that the Georgia laws were illegal, however President Andrew Jackson flagrantly violated this ruling and ordered the expulsion of the Cherokee Nation. This led directly to the infamous "Trail of Tears".`,

He immediately launched programs for social, ecological, and economic change, as well as renaming the country from the French colonial "Upper Volta" to Burkina Faso ("Land of Incorruptible People"), with its people being called Burkinabé ("upright people").\n\nHis administration was known for refusing foreign aid to remain politically independent, nationalizing the country's land and mineral wealth, and promoting literacy, women's rights, and public health. Among the achievements of his administration was vaccinating 2.5 million children against meningitis, yellow fever and measles.\n\nOn October 15th, 1987, Sankara was assassinated by troops led by Blaise Compaoré, who assumed leadership of the state shortly after having Sankara killed. A week before his assassination, Sankara declared: "While revolutionaries as individuals can be murdered, you cannot kill ideas".`,

On October 20th, 1981, he was captured while participating in an armored truck robbery (known as the Brinks Robbery of 1981) which killed two cops and a money courier. Balagoon was subsequently sentenced to life in prison.\n\nBalagoon authored several texts while in prison, writings that have become influential among black and other anarchists since first being published and distributed by anarchist prisoner support networks in the 1980s and 1990s. He died in prison of an AIDS-related illness on December 13th, 1986, aged 39.`,

In New York City, Isca helped spread anarchist ideas, a champion of the libertarian socialism advocated by Peter Kropotkin.\n\nSpeaking to anarchist historian Paul Avrich, he stated "Anarchism at bottom is an ethical philosophy.

The Christmas party was mostly attended by workers striking against the Calumet and Hecla Mining Company. Of the seventy-three people who were killed by the stampede of panicked party-goers, fifty-nine were children.\n\nThese workers had been on strike since mid-July, after management refused workers' demands for formal union recognition and a "conference with the employers to adjust wages, hours, and working conditions in the copper district of Michigan".\n\nWhen the false cry of "Fire!" was yelled, there were over four hundred people in the crowded party, and the stampede occurred when people rushed the staircase to the 1st floor. Although the culprit was never found, eight witnesses testified that the person who shouted it was wearing a "Citizen's Alliance" pin, a local anti-union group, and this claim is believed by some labor historians (Steve Lehto, in particular).\n\nThe event was memorialized by Woody Guthrie in the song "1913 Massacre".`,

It is one of the largest slave rebellions in the British Caribbean and was a major factor in the British government outlawing slavery in 1833. The name "Baptist War" came about because many of the rebels were Baptist in faith.\n\nThe rebellion was masterminded by the slave Samuel "Daddy" Sharpe, who had been given limited freedom to move around the island. Using this freedom of movement, Sharpe spread word of his plan and communicated with other slave leaders. After one prayer meeting, Sharpe cited examples of earlier slave revolts to encourage his followers, and then had them swear on a Bible to follow the plan he outlined.\n\nThe rebellion began on Christmas day when leaders of the uprising went on strike, demanding more free time and a working wage. The strike escalated into open revolt two days later, when the planters refused their demands. Sugar cane fields were set on fire and a rebel military group known as the Black Regiment defeated slaver forces on December 28th.\n\nThe rebellion was put down in early January, however sporadic resistance continued for another two months as the rebels resorted to guerilla tactics. More than three hundred enslaved men and women were executed for their role in the uprising, including Samuel Sharpe, who was hanged.`,

At the same time, Seminoles suffering under Creek rule in Alabama and Georgia were fleeing south to seek independence. There, the two groups formed an alliance, sharing cultivation techniques and putting up armed resistance against colonization and slaver forces.\n\nThe U.S. repeatedly invaded territory controlled by this alliance, and, on Christmas Day in 1837, 380 to 480 Seminole fighters gathered on the northeast corner of Florida's Lake Okeechobee ready to halt the armies of Colonel Zachary Taylor, a Louisiana slaveholder and future U.S. president. Seminole riflemen waited for the soldiers in trees, firing on them from above. The battle was a decisive defeat for U.S. forces, however Taylor falsely claimed a victory when returning to Fort Gardner.`,

The paper did not continue past 1933 and, by the end of the war, only six of the organizers involved with it survived; twenty-seven had been murdered by the Gestapo.\n\nAfter the war, Jelinek continued organizing with anarchists in East Germany, where he was critical of the Soviet state. In an unpublished pamphlet, written in 1947, Jelinek denounced the dictatorship of the proletariat "...which signifies the authority of the leaders. Where there is obedience, there are leaders who command". On November 10th, 1948, he was arrested by two Russian officers, and his son-in-law was arrested, disappearing without a trace.\n\nAlthough temporarily released, Jelinek continued to associate with anarchists and was once again arrested, this time sent to Bautzen, an East German prison. Under mysterious circumstances, he died there on March 24th, 1952.`,

Supporters credit him with driving imperialism out of China, modernizing the nation and building it into a world power, promoting the status of women, improving education and healthcare, and ultimately increasing the life expectancy of the average Chinese citizen.\n\nMao's critics hold him responsible for widespread political repression and violence, the Great Chinese Famine that occurred as part of agricultural collectivization, and the destruction of many cultural sites and artifacts during the Cultural Revolution.\n\n"Marxism comprises many principles, but in the final analysis they can all be brought back to a single sentence: it is right to rebel against reactionaries." - Mao Zedong`,

By late December 1862, US soldiers had taken captive more than a thousand Dakota, including women, children and elderly men in addition to warriors. A military tribunal tried the men, sentencing 303 to death for their crimes.\n\nPresident Lincoln commuted the sentence of 264 of them, and the remaining 38 were executed on December 26th in Mankato, Minnesota. The following year, the rest of the Dakota were expelled from Minnesota to Nebraska and South Dakota, and the United States Congress abolished their reservations.`,

There, he joined a small community of outlaws gathered in Jersey and published "La question révolutionnaire", an exposition of the philosophy of anarchism.\n\nLater, Déjacque moved to the UNited States, where he publicly condemned the hanging of John Brown abd promoted the abolitionist cause. As the American Civil War began, Déjacque published a last issue of his paper "Libertaire" with an urgent appeal in which he urges the American people, whom he would like to be "less religious and more socialist", to defend freedom and the Republic against the "Jesuits, slavers, absolutists and authoritarians" who were at their door.\n\nHe then returned to France, living his remaining years in poverty and passing away in 1864.`,

He felt it equated the Seminole with slaves, who were forbidden by law to carry arms.\n\nEarlier in 1835, Thompson had Osceola imprisoned for two nights in Fort King becase he felt disrespected by the Seminole warrior in a verbal disagreement. On December 28th, 1835, Seminole warriors shot and killed Thompson and six others outside Fort King, while another group of Seminole ambushed and killed a column of 100 U.S. troops who were marching from Fort Brooke to Fort King. This event is sometimes called the Dade Massacre or Dade Battle, and was a catalyst for the impending Second Seminole War.\n\nOn October 21st, 1837, in what has been called "one of the most disgraceful acts in U.S. military history", Osceola was captured after U.S. forces disingenuously agreed to meet under a white flag of truce. Osceola was arrested along with 81 of his followers, and he died in prison a few months later, on January 30th, 1838.`,

In some cases it acted as a labor union, negotiating with employers. K of L was notable in its ambition to organize across lines of gender and race and in the inclusion of both skilled and unskilled labor, although its support of the Chinese Exclusion Act is a notable exception to this.\n\nAfter a rapid expansion in the mid-1880s, the organization went into decline, primarily losing members to the American Federation of Labor (AFL).`,

        description: `The Wounded Knee Massacre was a domestic massacre of several hundred Lakota people (around half of whom were women and children), on this day in 1890, committed by soldiers of the U.S. Army. The massacre took place near Wounded Knee Creek in South Dakota, following a botched attempt to disarm the Lakota camp.\n\nAccording to the journalist Charles Allen who witnessed the massacre, the fighting began when soldiers tried to disarm a deaf Native American, and the gun went off in a struggle. Soldiers began firing indiscriminately, and, although the Lakota fought back, many of them had been disarmed by this point.\n\nBy the time the massacre was over, as many as 300 men, women, and children of the Lakota had been killed and 51 were wounded. For their efforts, twenty U.S. soldiers were awarded the Medal of Honor.\n\n"I shall not rest quiet in Montparnasse.\n\nI shall not lie easy at Winchelsea.\n\nYou may bury my body in Sussex grass,\n\nYou may bury my tongue at Champmedy.\n\nI shall not be there.\n\nI shall rise and pass.\n\nBury my heart at Wounded Knee."\n\n - Stephen Vincent Benet, from the poem "American Names"`,

        description: `On this day in 1986, striking hotel workers set fire to the Dupont Plaza Hotel in Puerto Rico in an attempt to scare off tourists; the fires burned out of control and killed more than 96 people.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the fire, there was significant labor strife at the Dupont Plaza Hotel. The tension was so great that locals were advising tourists to stay away from the hotel and its casino.\n\nOn December 31st, hotel workers voted to go on strike, and three of the labor organizers used chafing fuel to set a storage room on the ground floor on fire.\n\nAlthough their intent was to merely pressure management into agreeing to union demands, it quickly burned out of control, spreading to the adjacent ballroom and then casino. To prevent theft, hotel managers had locked emergency exits from the casino, and most of the deaths occurred there.\n\nThe fire claimed between 96 and 98 lives and caused 140 injuries, becoming the most catastrophic hotel fire in Puerto Rican history and the second deadliest in the history of the United States. The three labor organizers were convicted of murder and sentenced to varying prison terms.`,
